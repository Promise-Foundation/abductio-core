#+TITLE: ABDUCTIO Case Study Methodology Spec — Defensible Benchmarks Without Truth(T)
#+SUBTITLE: How to create case-study documents that remain valid when “reference conclusions” may be wrong
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:t

* 0. PURPOSE (meta)
This document specifies how to create *case study documents* (and domain-specific “case type specs”) that are defensible *without assuming Truth-with-a-capital-T*.

Core principle integrated:
- Reference findings (regulators, postmortems, boards, courts) are not Truth(T).
- They are *later, better-resourced inference states*.
- ABDUCTIO should be evaluated by *responsible epistemic behavior before those states are reachable*, not by agreement with them.

This spec defines:
- how to treat “answer keys” as *oracles* (fallible comparators),
- how to score outcomes without overcommitting to oracle correctness,
- how to document disagreement in a principled, publishable way.

* 1. UNDERSTAND (core question)
How do we integrate the “not Truth(T)” insight into a complete, reusable methodology for creating case study documents across domains?

* 2. ANALYZE (key components)
A defensible case study pipeline has 7 components:

1) *Scope definition* (what question are we evaluating?)
2) *Evidence freeze & packetization* (what was knowable at time T?)
3) *Hypothesis model* (MECE roots + exclusion clauses + Other policy)
4) *Oracle model* (what is the reference conclusion, and what is its epistemic status?)
5) *Method contract* (fairness: same inputs, same budget model)
6) *Evaluation targets* (what counts as “good” if oracle may be wrong?)
7) *Disagreement protocol* (how to treat ABDUCTIO-vs-oracle divergence)

* 2A. CASE STUDY PIPELINE ALIGNMENT (v2)
Case study execution MUST align with the canonical v2 framework in
`case_studies/abductio_v2_validation_framework.md`.

Required process constraints:
- *Evidence Freeze Time (T):* explicitly defined per case.
- *Allowed sections:* factual header + factual narrative + limited factual synopsis only.
- *Disallowed sections:* analysis, conclusion, safety actions.
- *No-hindsight gates:* enforce leakage checks; for AAIB, reference
  `case_studies/data/UK_AAIB_Reports/spec/evidence_packet_protocol.md`.

Ablation runs:
- An ablation run is any variant that changes exactly one system component
  (scheduler, template usage, decomposition policy, update rule).
- Each run MUST log a config hash, evaluator hash/spec, credit budget,
  and stopping rule.

Minimum required outputs per run:
- p/k traces per EVALUATE step
- credit ledger (per operation)
- allocation traces (per hypothesis/root)
- results.json (label-dependent and label-independent metrics)

* 3. REASON (logic linking the components)
If the oracle is fallible, then “accuracy vs label” is not the sole objective.
Instead:

- The oracle becomes *one* downstream inference state among several comparators.
- “Good performance” must include:
  - calibrated uncertainty,
  - defeater awareness,
  - auditability,
  - robustness to representation attacks (order/decomposition),
  - appropriate allocation to H_other when evidence is insufficient.

Therefore, case-study documents must explicitly encode:
- the oracle’s *strength* and *failure modes*,
- which evaluation metrics are label-dependent vs label-independent,
- and how to score “justified dissent.”

* 4. SYNTHESIZE (how it all fits together)
We treat each case as a timeline of epistemic states:

- E_T : evidence available at freeze time T (the benchmark input)
- O_L : later “oracle” conclusion produced with additional evidence/time/resources
- (optional) O_2, O_3 : other oracles / corroborators (appeals, independent reconstructions, alternative investigations)

ABDUCTIO is evaluated on:
- its *state at time T*, produced only from E_T under budget B,
- compared to O_L as a *downstream reference state*, not Truth(T).

* 5. CONCLUDE (deliverable)
What follows is the normative methodology spec you can use to create domain-specific documents and individual case writeups.

* 6. TERMINOLOGY (normative)
- *Evidence Freeze Time (T)*: the cutoff time; only information available at or before T is allowed in evidence packets.
- *Evidence Packet (E_T)*: the canonical benchmark input (bulleted, timestamped if possible).
- *Oracle*: any later, better-resourced inference product (final report, postmortem conclusion, judgment, regulator order).
- *Oracle Strength Class*: a documented assessment of oracle reliability for this case type.
- *Label*: a mapping from oracle conclusion -> one of the MECE roots (may be “soft” or “contested”).
- *Justified Dissent*: ABDUCTIO diverges from oracle *with explicit, audit-supported reasons* and appropriate confidence/uncertainty.

* 7. THE ORACLE MODEL (the big upgrade)
Every case type spec MUST include an explicit Oracle Model section.

** 7.1 Oracle Strength Classes (required)
Assign each oracle (per case type) to a strength class:

- OS-1 (Procedural Determination): conclusion is authoritative but evidence record is thin/opaque.
- OS-2 (Documented Determination): conclusion is supported by a public factual record, but incentives/PR/legal framing may distort.
- OS-3 (Investigative Determination): deep factual record + separation of facts/analysis + exhibits; still fallible.
- OS-4 (Multi-Oracle Convergence): multiple independent oracles converge (e.g., investigation board + court + independent expert report).
- OS-5 (Mechanistic Confirmation): the conclusion has direct mechanistic confirmation (e.g., component failure verified, pathology confirmed, reproducible exploit verified).

Normative constraint:
- Do not call any oracle “ground truth” unless OS-5 *and* the confirmation is explicitly documented.

** 7.2 Oracle Failure Modes (required)
Each case type spec MUST list typical failure modes, e.g.:
- hindsight bias / narrative smoothing
- institutional incentives (liability, political, PR, budget)
- incomplete data access / redactions
- single-point expert failure
- forced single-cause labeling when reality is multi-factor

** 7.3 Oracle Mapping Policy (required)
Define how oracle conclusions map to MECE roots:
- single-label mapping (preferred for S1 scopes)
- multi-label mapping (for contributing factors, only if benchmarked separately)
- contested mapping (if reasonable experts can map differently)
- “Other / Unknown” mapping (if oracle explicitly says uncertain/undetermined)

* 8. EVALUATION TARGETS (beyond “match the label”)
Each case study MUST report metrics in two buckets:

** 8.1 Label-dependent metrics (use carefully)
These treat oracle label as a *reference*, not Truth(T):

- Rank of oracle-mapped root
- Top-K coverage (does ABDUCTIO keep oracle root in top 2/3?)
- Log score / Brier score vs oracle label (reported with oracle strength class)
- Budget-efficiency curves for the above

Normative disclaimer:
- These metrics are “agreement with oracle,” not “truth accuracy.”

** 8.2 Label-independent metrics (core defensibility)
These do not require believing the oracle is correct:

- Audit Reproducibility: can a third party recompute ledger shifts from logs + cited evidence?
- Uncertainty Discipline: does k stay low when evidence is thin or contested?
- H_other Appropriateness (open-world): does residual mass rise when required slots remain weak?
- Defeater Awareness: are the strongest defeaters explicitly articulated and tracked?
- Robustness:
  - permutation invariance tests
  - decomposition sensitivity tests (DSI)
- Premature Commitment Rate:
  - how often does a method concentrate probability too early under weak evidence?

These are the flagship metrics for “responsible epistemic behavior.”

* 9. THE DISAGREEMENT PROTOCOL (the second big upgrade)
Every individual case document MUST include a Disagreement Protocol section.

** 9.1 Disagreement types (required)
If ABDUCTIO disagrees with the oracle, classify it:

- D0: No disagreement (same top root)
- D1: Soft disagreement (oracle root is in ABDUCTIO top-K; uncertainty acknowledged)
- D2: Competing lead (ABDuctio lead differs; oracle root still plausible)
- D3: Strong dissent (oracle root low-ranked), but ABDUCTIO k is also low (epistemic humility)
- D4: Strong dissent with high k (rare; requires high evidentiary traceability)

** 9.2 Justified Dissent Criteria (required for D2–D4)
ABDuctio dissent is *defensible* when:
1) It cites explicit evidence_refs supporting the dissenting root’s key NEC slots, and
2) It logs explicit defeaters for the oracle root, and
3) It keeps k appropriately bounded (high k requires OS-4/OS-5-level support), and
4) It identifies a concrete *hinge*:
   - “If evidence X is wrong / missing, the conclusion flips.”

** 9.3 Scoring disagreements (normative)
When oracle strength is low (OS-1/OS-2):
- Weight label-dependent penalties less.
- Weight label-independent metrics more.

When oracle strength is high (OS-4/OS-5):
- Disagreement is costlier, unless ABDUCTIO flags the dispute as low-k with clear hinges.

* 10. MULTI-ORACLE EVALUATION (recommended when feasible)
To avoid “single pronouncement benchmarking,” optionally add additional oracles:

- O_reg: regulator / board report
- O_court: judicial finding
- O_ind: independent expert report
- O_rep: replicated technical reproduction (when possible)

Report:
- agreement vs each oracle
- convergence / divergence notes
- whether ABDUCTIO anticipated later oracle shifts (e.g., appeals, amended postmortems)

* 11. CASE DOCUMENT TEMPLATE (what each case writeup MUST contain)
Each case writeup MUST include:

1) Case ID + Source URLs + retrieval dates + hashes
2) Scope statement (single sentence; choose S1/S2/S3 explicitly)
3) Evidence Freeze Time T (definition + justification)
4) Evidence Packet E_T (canonical; bulleted; timestamped where possible)
5) MECE Roots + Exclusion Clauses (+ H_other policy)
6) Budget Model + Budget B
7) Run Artifacts
   - ABDUCTIO run log (canonicalized)
   - baseline runs (same inputs/budget model)
8) Oracle Model for this case
   - oracle excerpt(s) + mapping policy
   - oracle strength class (OS-1..OS-5) + rationale
   - oracle failure mode notes (if relevant)
9) Results
   - label-dependent metrics (with disclaimers)
   - label-independent metrics (auditability/robustness/etc.)
10) Disagreement Protocol
   - D0..D4 classification
   - justified dissent checklist
   - hinges (what evidence would change the outcome?)
11) “What this case demonstrates” (1 paragraph; claim-bounded)

* 12. UPDATING YOUR EXISTING CASE TYPE SPECS (patch list)
For each existing type_spec.org (tech postmortems, transport safety, OSHA, medical, security, partner NDA, legal/regulatory), add:

- New Section: *Oracle Model*
  - typical oracle strength class for this type
  - common oracle failure modes
  - mapping policy (single vs multi-label; contested labels)

- New Section: *Evaluation Targets*
  - label-dependent vs label-independent metrics
  - required disclaimers

- New Section: *Disagreement Protocol*
  - D0..D4 classification
  - justified dissent criteria
  - how to write “ABDuctio vs Oracle” without claiming Truth(T)

- New Section: *Claims Policy for Website Publication*
  - allowed claims: auditability, robustness, humility, budget-efficiency, decomposition resilience
  - disallowed claims: “proves regulator wrong,” “Truth,” “objective posterior” without OS-5 evidence

* 13. CLAIMS YOU CAN DEFEND PUBLICLY (recommended wording)
Allowed claim templates:

- “Given only the evidence available by time T and a fixed budget, ABDUCTIO produced an auditable distribution over hypotheses.”
- “ABDuctio avoids premature certainty by allocating residual uncertainty to H_other when required slots remain weak.”
- “ABDuctio’s outputs are reproducible and invariant to input order and (within design) robust to decomposition attacks.”
- “Compared to baseline methods under identical inputs/budgets, ABDuctio produced fewer epistemically unjustified commitments.”

Avoid:
- “ABDuctio found the true cause” (unless OS-5 and clearly documented)
- “The regulator was wrong” (you can say: “ABDuctio remained unconvinced given E_T.”)

* 14. MINIMUM VIABLE DEFENSIBLE BENCHMARK (MVDB)
If you need a lean version:

Required:
- Evidence freeze + packet
- MECE roots + exclusion
- budget model
- ABDUCTIO run + at least one baseline
- oracle strength class + mapping policy
- at least 2 label-independent metrics (audit reproducibility, decomposition sensitivity)

Optional:
- multi-oracle, staged evidence, utilities/decision layer

* 15. OUTPUT ARTIFACTS (repo-standard)
For each case:

- evidence_packet.md
- roots.yaml
- oracle.md
  - oracle_excerpt
  - mapping rationale
  - oracle strength class
- runs/abductio/
- runs/baseline_checklist/
- runs/baseline_logodds/
- results.json
  - label-dependent metrics
  - label-independent metrics
  - disagreement classification
  - hinges

For each case type:

- type_spec.org (this methodology applied to the domain)
- metrics_spec.md (any domain-specific metrics)
- roots_library.yaml (starter MECE patterns)

* 16. FINAL NORMATIVE STATEMENT (include verbatim in each published benchmark)
“This benchmark does not assume Truth-with-a-capital-T. The reference conclusion is treated as a later, better-resourced inference state (an oracle) with documented strength and failure modes. ABDUCTIO is evaluated primarily on responsible epistemic behavior under frozen evidence and fixed budget: auditability, calibrated uncertainty, defeater awareness, and robustness to representation artifacts. Agreement with the oracle is reported as agreement, not as metaphysical truth.”
