#+TITLE: ABDUCTIO Data Source Processing Spec — AAIB UK Bulletin-Style Accident/Incident Reports
#+SUBTITLE: Turning AAIB bulletins into defensible ABDUCTIO benchmark cases
#+OPTIONS: toc:2 num:t

* 0. Purpose
This document defines a repeatable method for converting AAIB Bulletin-style reports into ABDUCTIO benchmark cases.

It is designed to be:
- *Anti-hindsight:* methods are evaluated on what was knowable before the investigation’s later synthesis.
- *Defensible without “Truth” access:* the AAIB’s determination is treated as a *later, better-resourced inference state*, not as capital-T Truth.
- *Auditable:* all transformations are reproducible from frozen source files.

* 1. What an AAIB bulletin report usually contains
Most reports include:
- A *header block* (aircraft type/registration, date/time, location, type of flight, injuries, damage, info source).
- A *Synopsis* summarizing the event and often (but not always) a causal story.
- A *History of the flight* narrative.
Some reports additionally include explicit sections such as:
- *Aircraft information / Meteorology / Recorded data / Wreckage examination*
- *Analysis*
- *Conclusion*
- *Safety actions / Safety recommendations*

Critical note: In some reports, the *Synopsis itself states the cause* (e.g., “The power loss was caused by…”). In others, the report explicitly states that *no definitive cause* was established. Both must be handled without leaking hindsight into the evidence packet.

* 2. Core principle: “Reference outcome” is not Truth
AAIB findings are treated as a *reference outcome* with:
- higher evidential coverage than earlier observers,
- better tooling and access,
- and an explicit institutional mandate.

But they are not assumed infallible. Therefore:
- A benchmark should report agreement with the reference outcome, *and also* report whether the method behaves responsibly under uncertainty (humility, stability, auditability).
- Cases where the AAIB does not establish a definitive cause must be supported as first-class “open-world” cases (ie, “undetermined” is an allowed outcome class).

* 3. Benchmark scopes suitable for this source
Choose exactly one scope per dataset slice.

Recommended single-label scopes:
- *S1 (Proximate mechanism):* “What mechanism most directly produced the loss of control / impact / damage outcome?”
- *S2 (Preventable mechanism):* “What primary preventable mechanism would have broken the causal chain at highest leverage?”

Avoid scopes that require private evidence not present in the public report.

* 4. Artifact outputs per case
Each AAIB report selected into the corpus must be transformed into these artifacts:

- *scope.org or scope.md*
  A single sentence defining the benchmark question and what counts as “correct.”

- *evidence_packet.md*
  A strictly “pre-conclusion” evidence bundle given to all methods.

- *answer_key.md* (kept separate / gated)
  The reference outcome text + mapping to your root set + strength rating.

- *roots.yaml*
  The MECE roots (with exclusion clauses) used for the case.

- *source_manifest.json*
  File hash, retrieval date, and section cut rules used.

* 5. Sectioning rules: what goes into evidence vs held-out
** 5.1 Allowed in the Evidence Packet
The evidence packet may include:
- Header facts (date/time/location, operation type, injuries, damage).
- Narrative facts from “History of the flight” and “Factual information”-style sections.
- Observations, measurements, and quoted witness statements.
- Timelines and data plots treated as observations (not interpretations).

** 5.2 Held-out (the Answer Key material)
Hold out:
- Any explicit *cause attribution* statements from the Synopsis.
- “Analysis” sections (when present).
- “Conclusion / Probable cause / Causal factor identified” sections (when present).
- “Safety actions / recommendations” unless the benchmark scope is specifically prevention-focused.

** 5.3 Special handling: Synopsis that mixes facts + causation
If the Synopsis contains both:
- a factual event summary, and
- causal attribution,
then split it:
- Keep the *event summary* (what happened).
- Hold out the *causal attribution sentences* (why it happened).

Rule of thumb:
- If a sentence asserts a mechanism (“was caused by”, “the cause was”, “most probably stalled because”), it is held-out.

* 5A. Evidence Freeze and Leakage Gates (AAIB-specific)
Evidence packets MUST comply with:
- `case_studies/data/UK_AAIB_Reports/spec/evidence_packet_protocol.md`
- `case_studies/data/UK_AAIB_Reports/spec/leakage_checks.md`

Required leakage audit elements per build:
- Count of items dropped by each rule
- Keyword hits (soft and hard gates)
- Evidence packet hashes
- Two-independent-builder agreement on a subset

* 6. Open-world handling (“undetermined” is valid)
AAIB reports sometimes explicitly state that no definitive cause was established.
In that situation:
- Include an explicit root such as *H_undetermined_or_other* in the MECE set.
- Mark the case as *open-world* in index.csv.
- The answer key records the reference as “undetermined” with a high-strength tag (because the report is explicitly refusing to close the world).

Evaluation then emphasizes:
- avoiding overconfident collapse onto a single story,
- allocating meaningful mass to “other/undetermined” when evidence is insufficient,
- and producing an audit trail that makes uncertainty legible.

* 7. Root-set construction for AAIB cases
** 7.1 Granularity discipline
AAIB narratives often include both:
- proximate mechanical/operational mechanisms, and
- deeper organizational/system contributors.
Do not mix levels in a single MECE set.

If you need both, create two benchmarks:
- Layer A: proximate mechanism (single-label).
- Layer B: contributing/systemic factors (multi-label; separate evaluation).

** 7.2 Recommended starter root patterns (proximate)
- H_flight_handling_loss_of_control (stall/spin, mis-handling, unstable approach)
- H_powerplant_or_propulsion_anomaly
- H_system_or_component_failure
- H_configuration_or_procedural_error (wrong setting, checklist/crew coordination)
- H_environmental_or_weather_factor
- H_ground_handling_or_airport_interface (pushback/tug, runway incursion/obstacle)
- H_other_or_undetermined

Add exclusion clauses so roots do not overlap (eg, “system failure excluding pilot control inputs,” etc).

* 7A. Root-set validation (AAIB-specific)
Root sets MUST pass the MECE checks in:
- `case_studies/data/UK_AAIB_Reports/spec/root_set_validation.md`

* 8. Reference outcome extraction + strength grading
Each case’s answer key must include:
- A *reference statement* (quoted or tightly paraphrased).
- The *section source* (Conclusion / Analysis / Synopsis causal sentence).
- A *strength grade*:

Suggested grading:
- A: Explicit “Conclusion / Cause / Causal factor identified” section, unambiguous.
- B: Strong causal statement in Analysis, but with hedging or partial uncertainty.
- C: Cause implied only by synopsis wording, operator statement, or weak evidence.

If the report states “no definitive cause,” treat that as:
- A-strength for *undetermined* (a strong refusal to label), not as C-strength.

** 8.1 Oracle strength usage in scoring
- Record OS class for every case (map A/B/C to OS-3/OS-2/OS-1 if needed).
- Label-dependent metrics must be reported with OS context.
- Tier 2 analyses should stratify by OS class or include OS as a covariate.

* 9. Evidence staging (optional but recommended)
Some cases can be staged to emulate real-time investigation:
- T0: Header + immediate outcome + initial witness observations.
- T1: Full history narrative.
- T2: Technical examination data (still factual-only).
- (Held-out): Analysis/Conclusion.

If staged, all methods receive the same staged releases and the same budget per stage.

* 10. Fairness contract (non-negotiables)
For a benchmark run to be valid, all methods must share:
- identical scope statement,
- identical evidence packet(s),
- identical root set (same wording and exclusions),
- identical budget model (credits/steps/time),
- identical mapping rules from outputs to root IDs.

* 10A. Evaluator constraints (AAIB-specific)
- Evaluators must be deterministic (fixed seed, temperature, and model version).
- External citations are not required because evidence is local.
- Reproducibility is mandatory: log evaluator spec and reuse matched calls for ablations.

* 11. Metrics to report (beyond agreement with the AAIB)
Because the reference outcome is not Truth, report both agreement and responsibility:

Agreement metrics (when labelable):
- Top-1 accuracy / Top-k accuracy
- Brier score or log score (if probabilistic)

Responsibility metrics (always):
- Calibration by confidence bucket
- “Humility under thin evidence”: mass assigned to H_other_or_undetermined when warranted
- Robustness: sensitivity to (a) hypothesis ordering, (b) root decomposition changes
- Auditability: can an auditor reproduce each update from the run log?

* 12. Recommended folder layout for this source
reports/aaib_uk_bulletin/
  index.csv
  processing_spec.org (this file)
  cases/
    <case_id>/
      source.pdf
      source_manifest.json
      scope.md
      evidence_packet.md
      roots.yaml
      answer_key.md          (gated or in a separate private folder if desired)
      runs/

* 13. Minimal “done” definition for a new case
A case is considered ready when:
- source.pdf is frozen and hashed,
- evidence_packet.md contains no causal-attribution leakage,
- roots.yaml is MECE with explicit exclusions,
- answer_key.md includes reference statement + strength grade,
- index.csv row is complete and selected_for_corpus=Y.
