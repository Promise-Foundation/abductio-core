Distraction of the tug instructor due to multitasking (focusing on training/communicating with the trainee while driving)
Credence: 80% (primary contributing factor, as the instructor explicitly reported focusing on the trainee, which aligns with the ANC framework where communication was prioritized over aviate/navigate).
Confidence: High (directly supported by instructor's statement and human performance section on situation awareness and task prioritization).

Failure of other ground crew members to intervene or communicate a warning (e.g., trainee, headset operator, and wingman assuming the instructor knew what he was doing)
Credence: 60% (significant team dynamic issue, with multiple crew members noticing the overshoot but not acting, despite training to challenge unsafe actions).
Confidence: High (evident from individual statements where each deferred to the instructor's authority without verbal or signal intervention).

Inadequate prominence or visibility of the Tug Release Point (TRP) marking
Credence: 40% (contributory design factor, as the small, one-sided marking was noted as hard to see and obscured, leading to post-accident upgrades).
Confidence: Medium (mentioned by crew, but the airport's upgrade suggests it was a recognized issue, though not definitively causal without analysis).

Lack of opposing thrust from the aircraft's engines (allowing the tug to continue moving at idle power)
Credence: 30% (procedural factor that reduced the physical cues for stopping, as engines were not started per remote hold plan).
Confidence: Medium (noted by instructor as unusual but not uncommon; it amplified the error but wasn't the root initiation).

Inexperience or training gaps in the team (e.g., trainee's limited experience, headset operator never having seen a TRP physically)
Credence: 20% (background factor, as the trainee was on her second pushback and some crew had theoretical but not practical familiarity with TRPs).
Confidence: Medium (inferred from crew qualifications and reports, but the ground handling agency promoted a just culture and post-accident reminders).
