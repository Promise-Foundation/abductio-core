They arrived at approximately 1000 hrs and moved the aircraft out of its hangar. The surviving syndicate member described the pre-flight checks as \u201call good.\u201d That pilot boarded the aircraft and taxied out at approximately 1200 hrs. He conducted a general handling flight in the local area for 30 minutes, during which there were no technical issues with the aircraft. He parked the aircraft near point B for the crew change."

The elevator could then be observed to move to a pitch up (control surface up) position, which was near to its full travel position, and the tail of the aircraft quickly lowered back towards the runway. The elevator remained in a pitch-up position, whilst the tailwheel tyre bounced on and off the runway surface several times.

As the aircraft reached the side of the runway its airspeed was approximately 63 kt and it pitched up quickly at a rate of about 12\u1d52/s and started to climb. The elevators could then be seen to move quickly to a more neutral position. The pitch attitude reached just over 20\u1d52 and the data indicated that the aircraft\u2019s airspeed reduced to approximately 58 kt.
