The elevator could then be observed to move to a pitch up (control surface up) position, which was near to its full travel position, and the tail of the aircraft quickly lowered back towards the runway. The elevator remained in a pitch-up position, whilst the tailwheel tyre bounced on and off the runway surface several times.

As the aircraft reached the side of the runway its airspeed was approximately 63 kt and it pitched up quickly at a rate of about 12\u1d52/s and started to climb. The elevators could then be seen to move quickly to a more neutral position. The pitch attitude reached just over 20\u1d52 and the data indicated that the aircraft\u2019s airspeed reduced to approximately 58 kt.

When the aircraft\u2019s bank angle reached about 30 \u1d52, its pitch attitude briefly stabilised at about 15 \u1d52 nose-up but as the bank angle reached about 40 \u1d52 the roll rate increased quickly to about 70\u1d52/s.

The pitch attitude reached just over 20\u00b0 and the data indicated that the aircraft\u2019s airspeed reduced to approximately 58 kt.
