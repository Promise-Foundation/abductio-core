They arrived at approximately 1000 hrs and moved the aircraft out of its hangar. The surviving syndicate member described the pre-flight checks as \u201call good.\u201d That pilot boarded the aircraft and taxied out at approximately 1200 hrs. He conducted a general handling flight in the local area for 30 minutes, during which there were no technical issues with the aircraft. He parked the aircraft near point B for the crew change."

The elevator could then be observed to move to a pitch up (control surface up) position, which was near to its full travel position, and the tail of the aircraft quickly lowered back towards the runway. The elevator remained in a pitch-up position, whilst the tailwheel tyre bounced on and off the runway surface several times. The aircraft\u2019s weight then settled on the tail wheel, which was almost coincident with the main landing gear tyres leaving the runway surface."

The aircraft\u2019s pitch attitude was about 12 \u1d52 nose-up. As the aircraft reached the side of the runway its airspeed was approximately 63 kt and it pitched up quickly at a rate of about 12\u1d52/s and started to climb. The elevators could then be seen to move quickly to a more neutral position. The pitch attitude reached just over 20\u1d52 and the data indicated that the aircraft\u2019s airspeed reduced to approximately 58 kt. The aircraft then started rolling left, with a slight reduction in its pitch attitude to about 18\u1d52 nose-up."

The footage of the aircraft captured by the witness ended shortly after this point but the continuing flight path of the aircraft was recorded by one of the CCTV cameras. When the aircraft\u2019s bank angle reached about 30 \u1d52, its pitch attitude briefly stabilised at about 15 \u1d52 nose-up but as the bank angle reached about 40 \u1d52 the roll rate increased quickly to about 70\u1d52/s. The aircraft\u2019s nose started to drop and the aircraft descended, with the bank angle reaching about 120\u1d52 before the aircraft struck the ground, left wingtip first, at 1257:40 hrs."

The recording indicated that this engine speed was maintained as the aircraft took off through to the aircraft subsequently striking the ground.
