Tyre marks were also discovered on the extreme end of the runway. Based on the nature of the marks, their orientation and location, as well as the track between them, it was determined they were made by an aircraft rather than a ground vehicle. The airfield boundary fence in the Rwy 07 undershoot had also sustained damage. The barbed wire support arm on one fence pole was missing and the wire had been severed in that location."
