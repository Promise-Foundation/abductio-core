## Evidence items
- [H1] (history) During an airfield inspection at TUPJ, which began at 1900 hrs Z on 6 November, it was found that a frangible light at the western edge of the Rwy 07 undershoot was missing. Tyre marks were also discovered on the extreme end of the runway. Based on the nature of the marks, their orientation and location, as well as the track between them, it was determined they were made by an aircraft rather than a ground vehicle. The airfield boundary fence in the Rwy 07 undershoot had also sustained damage. The barbed wire support arm on one fence pole was missing and the wire had been severed in that location.
- [H2] (history) Safety reporting With damage to airfield infrastructure having been found, the airfield duty manager submitted a Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR) to Air Safety Support International (ASSI) on 9 November 2024. In the MOR, the event type was recorded as ‘ Incident.’ Following a review of the report, ASSI reclassified the event as a Serious Incident and notified the AAIB on 6 January 2025.
- [H3] (history) Unaware that the aircraft had struck any obstacles on the approach, the flight crew did not submit a safety report about the landing but provided the following brief statement on 8 November 2024 in response to the TUPJ airfield authorities’ enquiries.
- [H4] (history) ‘On November 6 the weather was marginal with rain on all quadrants, upon approaching runway 7 on short final started to experience wind gusts and probably a downdraft [sic], seemed close to a low-level wind shear. Applied power to arrest the descent. I landed slightly short of the numbers. I was totally unaware that I struck [anything].’ Although they were requested from the commander, further details of the occurrence, which could have provided greater insight into the content and context of their 8 November statement, were not provided to the AAIB.
- [H5] (history) ICAO Annex (Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation) Attachment C lists typical examples of incidents that are likely to be classified as serious. This list includes: ‘Take-off or landing incidents. Incidents such as under-shooting, overrunning or running off the side of runways.’ The operator did not instigate an internal safety review for this serious incident.
- [H6] (history) Personnel The commander did not supply the investigation with details of their flight licence, medical status, flying experience or recency.
- [H7] (history) Meteorology The reports submitted to the AAIB did not contain meteorological information, but the UK Met Office generated a limited aftercast for the time of the serious incident. The report found that: ● The weather conditions on the day were characterised by light east to north easterly winds with scattered cloud.
- [H8] (history) ● The TUPJ TAF included a risk of thunderstorms from 1800 hrs UTC, with an associated forecast reduction in visibility and cloud bases.
- [H9] (history) ● The reported intensity of the rainfall at the airfield along with the number of lightning strikes recorded on the weather radar imagery at indicated an active CB cell was over or close to the territory at the time of the serious incident.
- [H10] (history) ● There was no indication of any significant wind shear in association with the thunderstorms, but the Met Office did not have access to the full record of wind speed or direction.
- [H11] (history) Weather radar image at 1900 hrs Z on 6 November 2024 (crosses indicate lightning strikes) Aircraft examination The flight crew did not notice any aircraft damage on the turnaround at TUPJ. During maintenance action after the return flight ‘marks of contact’ were found on the left mainwheel tyre which required it to be removed and replaced. The operator did not identify any other airframe damage.
- [H12] (history) The runway chart for TUPJ alerts pilots to occasional windshear on the approach to Rwy 07 when the winds are from the south and south-east.
- [S1] (synopsis) On arrival at Terrance B Lettsome International Airport (TUPJ) in the British Virgin Islands, N915GD was likely affected by nearby thunderstorm activity, reportedly experiencing a downdraught on short finals. Despite the commander applying more power to “arrest the descent”, the aircraft initially touched down on the lip of Runway (Rwy 07), approximately 150 m short of the threshold. It then bounced and touched down again close to the threshold.
- [S2] (synopsis) The airfield operations team later found a frangible runway light had been damaged by the aircraft when it undershot the runway.
- [S3] (synopsis) While he knew the aircraft initially touched down in the undershoot, the commander was unaware that it had struck the light and did not file an occurrence report. The aircraft returned to its home base approximately one hour later.
