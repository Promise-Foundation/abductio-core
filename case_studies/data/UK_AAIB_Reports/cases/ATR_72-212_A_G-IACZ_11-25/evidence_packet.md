## Evidence items
- [H1] (history) The plan was to fly two sectors as a return service between Newquay and London Gatwick.
- [S1] (synopsis) The flaps could not be deployed to full extension for landing and the commander decided to perform a go-around. Weather conditions were unfavourable so after initially declaring a MAYDAY, the aircraft diverted to Exeter Airport where landing flap was achieved. The landing was uneventful, but several unrelated anomalies were reported to have occurred during the subsequent ground taxi.
