Pilots were grouped into three categories: Novice, Intermediate, and Pundit. The pilot of G-DJMD competed in the Intermediate Class, tasked with a 156 km course, while the pilot of G-DCTB was in the Novice Class, assigned a shorter route of 118 km.

The pilot acknowledged the radio call and initiated a turn to the left to position behind the glider.
