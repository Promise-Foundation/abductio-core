The BGA argued that CAA policy, which requires airfield operators to deliver an AGCS to qualify for a discrete radio frequency, was inappropriate and potentially unsafe for gliding operations. The BGA highlighted that gliding clubs often experience unpredictable and dense traffic patterns, with many gliders simultaneously airborne and circuit activity that differs significantly from typical general aviation airfields. They believed that as direct pilot-to-pilot communication was essential for effective deconfliction, delivering an AGCS would be impractical and may even reduce safety at gliding clubs. Furthermore, the BGA argued that many clubs have a high volume of annual movements, justifying the need for their own discrete frequencies to prevent the overlap of radio calls with neighbouring airfields."
