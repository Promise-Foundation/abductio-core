The BGA highlighted that gliding clubs often experience unpredictable and dense traffic patterns, with many gliders simultaneously airborne and circuit activity that differs significantly from typical general aviation airfields. They believed that as direct pilot-to-pilot communication was essential for effective deconfliction, delivering an AGCS would be impractical and may even reduce safety at gliding clubs.
