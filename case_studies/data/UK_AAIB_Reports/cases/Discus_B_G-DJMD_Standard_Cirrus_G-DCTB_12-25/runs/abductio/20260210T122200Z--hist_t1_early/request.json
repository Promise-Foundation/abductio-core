Pilots were grouped into three categories: Novice, Intermediate, and Pundit. The pilot of G-DJMD competed in the Intermediate Class, tasked with a 156 km course, while the pilot of G-DCTB was in the Novice Class, assigned a shorter route of 118 km. The primary distinction between classes was the course length."

When descending through 800 ft on final, he observed a glider on a \u201ctight left base\u201d for Runway 06 just below his level. He transmitted on the Hinton Radio frequency, \u201cglider, are you going in ahead of me?\u201d, receiving the response, \u201cI\u2019m number one\u201d. The pilot acknowledged the radio call and initiated a turn to the left to position behind the glider. As he turned, he saw another glider, that appeared to be aligned with Runway 09, slightly behind but level with the first."

G-DJMD was lined up with Runway (grass) and G-DCTB was slightly lower and ahead on a shallower approach profile, apparently lined up with Runway (hard). As they approached the airfield boundary, G-DCTB made a \u201cshallow right turn\u201d towards Runway (grass), which was occupied with three gliders waiting to launch. G-DCTB\u2019s airbrakes were observed to be closed or partially closed. The manoeuvre placed G-DCTB on a conflicting path with G-DJMD."

This unit was disassembled, as it records flight data including aircraft track and orientation, and several flights worth of data were successfully retrieved from its onboard non-volatile memory. However, the accident flight was not recovered. The manufacturer commented that a firmware update, to fix a known issue with correctly recording the GPS date, had not been applied and that some of the memory space reserved for recordings appeared corrupted; this may have affected the recording of the accident flight."
