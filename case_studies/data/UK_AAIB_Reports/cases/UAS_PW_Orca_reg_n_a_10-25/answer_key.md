## Reference statement
A change to the aircraft’s operating software by its manufacturer meant that, under a 
particular set of circumstances, it no longer performed as intended. The SRP controller 
selection had remained in the disarm position when the aircraft took off, and the software 
bug resulted in the unintended in-flight shutdown of the aircraft’s electric propulsion motors, 
the disabling of the aircraft’s safety parachute system from deploying, and a subsequent 
uncontrolled descent from a height of 60 m.

This accident highlights the importance of ensuring that change management processes 
include comprehensive scenario testing, particularly for safety-critical functions.  While the 
manufacturer followed an iterative development process, this incident emphasises the need 
to validate software behaviour against all known operational cases.
