## Synopsis (causal sentences removed)
The aircraft struck the ground in a wooded area whilst on approach to land at a site adjacent 
to Coventry Hospital. The accident occurred during the sixth consecutive flight, which was in 
preparation for demonstrating the aircraft being operated in accordance with the operator’s 
Beyond Visual Line Of Sight with Visual Mitigations (BVLOS VM) authorisation. The cause of the accident was identified as a software bug in combination with a loss 
of synchronisation between the Remote Pilot (RP) and the Safety Remote Pilot (SRP), 
whereby the SRP’s hand controller had remained set to the disarm position when the 
aircraft had taken off. When the aircraft came within range of the SRP’s controller, this 
resulted in power being removed from the aircraft’s electric propulsion motors, leading to 
the aircraft stalling, its emergency parachute system being disabled, and a subsequent 
uncontrolled descent from a height of 60 m.

## History of the flight
A number of flights were being flown a total distance of about 1.5 nm between a farm and a 
field adjacent to Coventry Hospital (Figure 1).  These were being performed in preparation 
for a BVLOS VM demonstration flight.

The flight crew consisted of a Remote Pilot (RP), Safety Remote Pilot (SRP), Pad Manager 
(PM), Visual Observer (VO) 1 and an Emergency Response Team (ERP).  The PM was 
located at the farm site and had a handheld controller that allowed the aircraft to take off and 
land.  The SRP was at the hospital landing site and had a remote controller that provided 
the ability to take manual flight control of the aircraft, arm and disarm it and also terminate 
flight in the event of an emergency (refer to the aircraft information section for further 
detail).  The RP was at the operator’s facility some miles away and was using a PC-based 
ground control station to control the aircraft, with the VO located about midway between the  
two sites and the ERP collocated with the SRP (Figure 1).
Coordination between the flight crew was made using two-way radios, with the control 
settings of the RP and SRP controllers being manually synchronised by each pilot, so that 
the aircraft was appropriately armed in preparation for flight and disarmed (shutdown) after 
each landing.
Five flights were successfully flown over the period of about an hour and, having completed 
the ground checks at the farm site, the aircraft took off to fly back to the hospital landing site.  
The aircraft climbed vertically to a height of about 50 m agl before transitioning to forward 
flight where it then climbed to its cruise height of 60 m agl.  The aircraft’s takeoff weight was 
38.9 kg.
The aircraft was observed to follow the planned flight profile but as it approached approximately 
the halfway point the aircraft’s motors suddenly stopped.  The aircraft initially maintained 
altitude but subsequently stalled, before descending quickly and striking the ground within 
a wooded area (Figure 1).  No persons were injured and there was no damage to property; 
the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
The RP, SRP and PM reported that they had not made any selections on their respective 
controllers in the period before the aircraft departed from controlled flight.
Footnote
1 The VO is a designated person who assists the pilot during BVLOS flights.  The VO’s primary responsibility is 
to maintain visual contact with the aircraft and its surroundings, alerting the remote pilot who may not be able 
to observe the aircraft to any potential hazards or conflicts.  The VO provides the visual mitigations required 
by the BVLOS VM authorisation.

Aircraft information
The aircraft (Figure 3) is an unmanned, electrically powered vertical takeoff and landing 
aircraft.  It is equipped with eight propulsion motors.  Six motors are installed under the 
wings, and these provide vertical takeoff and landing capability.  Two motors are mounted at 
the front of the wings that provide propulsion during forward flight.  The MTOW of the aircraft 
is 52 kg with a cruise speed of 60 kt and maximum range of 54 nm.
The aircraft is controlled remotely from a ground control station, and by an optional 
SRP controller.  The ground control station to aircraft communications system provides 
uninterrupted signals that enable the aircraft to be operated BVLOS.  The signals between 
the SRP controller and aircraft are limited by range and line of sight.
At the time of report publication, 26 aircraft have been manufactured, of which 20 remain 
in operational service.  The accident aircraft had accumulated a total of 13 hours and  
59 minutes flight time and had completed 119 flights prior to the accident.  This was the first 
accident involving this type.

Flight termination system (FTS) 
The aircraft is equipped with a FTS which, when activated, removes power from its electric 
propulsion motors and deploys the parachute2.  The ailerons also move to place the aircraft 
into a spin, which is intended to quickly reduce any forward movement of the aircraft as it 
descends.  This system can bring the aircraft safely to the ground at a controlled rate in 
the event of an emergency.  The aircraft manufacturer’s minimum deployable height for the 
parachute to be fully effective is 60 m above the ground3.
The FTS activates automatically if the aircraft’s descent rate exceeds 2,000 fpm, or it can 
be manually triggered by selection of a terminate push button on the RP ground station or 
switch on the SRP controller (Figure 4).
Arm and disarm function
The arm and disarm function applied or removed power to the electric propulsion motors 
respectively and enabled or disabled remote control of the aircraft.  Upon landing the aircraft 
was designed to automatically disarm itself, enabling it to be safely approached by ground 
personnel.  The design of the system also allowed the aircraft to be manually disarmed 
when in flight or on the ground.
The manufacturer advised that the ability to manually disarm the aircraft was provided as it 
was possible after an abnormal landing, a failed takeoff or entanglement on the ground that 
the aircraft may not always automatically disarm.  It was envisaged that the manual disarm 
function would only be used when the aircraft was close to, or on the ground.
The aircraft is fitted with two physical switches that enable its hardware (power made 
available to motors and control systems) to be armed or disarmed.  Once the hardware 
was armed, the aircraft’s control software could then be armed and capable of responding 
to remote commands from the RP, SRP and PM controllers.  It could be disarmed using a 
press and hold switch on the RP ground control station or by selection of a toggle switch on 
the SRP controller (Figure 4).
Footnote
2 The parachute manufacturer refers to the model fitted to the aircraft as a ‘Tough G2 parachute system’.
3 The parachute manufacturer specified that the minimum height was 40 m, but the aircraft manufacturer 
provided an additional safety margin to take account of the vertical and horizontal velocity of the aircraft and 
time to fully deploy the parachute.

RP controller showing disarm and arm switch
The manufacturer had considered the scenario of the aircraft being in flight and the SRP 
controller being inadvertently set to the disarm position when the aircraft came within range 
of the controller.  To prevent the inadvertent in-flight shutdown of the aircraft, the system 
was intended so that it should require the received signal to change state from disarm to 
arm and then back to disarm before it would respond.  A description of the operation of the 
SRP controller arm/disarm switch was provided in the manufacturer’s Flight and Ground 
Control Technical Manual (Figure 5).

SRP controller switch operation
(Dated 23 April 2025 Revision 1.4)
After the accident, the aircraft manufacturer confirmed to the operator that if the aircraft 
was disarmed in flight that the FTS would also be disabled; this information was included 
in the aircraft’s technical manual provided to the operator within the section concerning the 
operation of the parachute system which stated:
‘The Tough [G]2 is unlocked and locked automatically when the aircraft is armed 
and disarmed with the hardware arming switches.  Furthermore, all parachute 
activation conditions of the Tough G2 are only enabled when the aircraft is 
armed by software.’
The aircraft operator stated that it had not appreciated that the FTS would be disabled in 
flight if the aircraft was disarmed and noted that, unlike the SRP control selections in the 
technical manual, the statement about the parachute arming was not similarly emphasised 
to draw attention to it.  The operator considered the ability to disarm the aircraft in flight 
to pose a safety hazard and subsequently requested the manufacturer to remove this 
capability.
Recorded information
Recorded data was available from onboard the aircraft and the RP ground control station.  
The onboard data included the control signals received from the RP station.  It also included 
those from the SRP controller4 but only when it was in range.  The SRP controller does not 
record any data.
Footnote
4 The remote pilot ground station uses a command-and-control signal (C2) which is designed to provide a 
permanent connection with the aircraft.  The remote safety pilot controller uses a 2.4 GHz radio frequency 
signal that will lose connection when the aircraft is either out of range or the signal is masked by terrain 
features or structures.

The data showed that during the flight prior to the accident, the SRP controller was correctly 
set to the arm position.  This signal was recorded by the aircraft for about 90 seconds until 
it moved out of range of the SRP controller and communication was lost.  About 80 seconds 
later, the aircraft landed at the farm site, where the PM replaced the aircraft’s battery pack.  
The aircraft then took off to fly back to the hospital site under automatic flight control.
The takeoff and initial cruise were normal, and when at a distance of about 0.7 nm from 
the hospital site, the communication link was re-established between the aircraft and  
SRP controller.  The recorded signals showed that at this point the arm/disarm switch on the 
SRP controller was in the disarm position.  Almost immediately the aircraft responded by 
removing power to its electric propulsion motors and the aircraft’s airspeed started to quickly 
reduce.  The aircraft initially continued to maintain altitude using its elevators, but eventually 
stalled, after which it rolled to the right and descended.  The descent rate reached about 
3,000 fpm before the aircraft struck the ground.  A summary of the recorded data from the 
aircraft is provided below:

Training and operating procedures
The operator of the accident aircraft had received operational training provided by the 
aircraft manufacturer.  This included the use of the ground control station, SRP and PM 
controllers.  The operator stated that the training content did not include that the FTS would 
be disabled in flight if the aircraft was disarmed.
The operator advised that its procedure in the event of an in-flight emergency was to activate 
the FTS and that the disarm function would only be selected when the aircraft was on the 
ground.
It also advised that its normal procedure was for the SRP and RP to verbally coordinate 
the selection of the arm/disarm selections on their respective controllers.  This included 
setting the controllers to disarm after landing, and arm in preparation for flight, irrespective 
of whether the SRP controller was in communication range of the aircraft.  However, the 
operator’s checklist did not include a ‘check and challenge’ of the arm/disarm settings.
Operational authorisation (OA)
The operator of the aircraft held an OA issued by the UK CAA.  The OA did not explicitly 
require the use of an SRP, but it did refer to the operator’s Operation Manual Volume 1 
which included the use of an SRP when operating the aircraft type.
The aircraft manufacturer stated that the aircraft type was operated in eight countries, of 
which four were in Europe (including the UK) and four in Asia and further advised that of all 
the operators, only that of the accident aircraft used an SRP.  The manufacturer considered 
that an SRP was unnecessary, with the use of a SRP controller increasing the operational 
complexity of the system and that a loss of SRP and RP settings could subsequently occur.
The aircraft operator stated that it was reviewing its operational procedures regarding the 
advantages and disadvantages of using an SRP when operating the aircraft type.

Aircraft software and testing
In November 2024, an updated version of the aircraft operating software was released by its 
manufacturer.  This introduced a signal filter that incorporated a 200 ms delay intended to 
resolve infrequent ‘glitches’ in SRP controller signals received by the aircraft.  This software 
was installed on the accident aircraft.
The manufacturer advised that it followed a software development process intended 
to encompass iterative testing prior to final release.  However, after the accident the 
manufacturer advised that it had omitted to test the scenario of an aircraft in flight establishing 
communication with an SRP controller that was set to disarm.  When this scenario was then 
tested, the ‘de-glitch’ signal filter inadvertently resulted in the aircraft immediately disarming.
