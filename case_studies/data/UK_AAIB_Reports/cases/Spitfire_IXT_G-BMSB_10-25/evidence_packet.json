      "text": "The aircraft was operating on a Safety Standards Acknowledgement and Consent (SSAC) passenger flight and was flying in formation with another Spitfire. It had been flying for about 35 minutes and was roughly two miles south of Lympne Castle in Kent, when the pilot noticed a slight engine vibration. He checked the engine temperatures, pressures and rpm, all of which appeared normal. However, within five seconds of the onset of the vibration, the engine rapidly lost power. It then briefly recovered, surged and appeared to lose power again. The engine started to backfire and the pilot observed dark coloured smoke emanating from the exhausts. He briefly experimented with moving the throttle to see if he could find a point where the engine would produce power, but this was unsuccessful. The pilot noted a smell of fuel in the cockpit so suspected a fuel problem. The aircraft rapidly lost airspeed and the pilot lowered the nose, chose a suitable area of open ground and made a gradual 10\u00b0 right turn to line up and carry out a forced landing. He briefed his passenger, who remained calm throughout. He was in radio contact with the other Spitfire pilot who relayed a MAYDAY to Biggin Hill ATC on his behalf. He then concentrated on maintaining airspeed and energy throughout the descent but was able to establish the low fuel pressure warning light had illuminated so selected the boost pump on. He also checked the magneto switches but neither action made any difference. He decided not to lower the landing gear. He made a slight heading adjustment to avoid overflying a caravan park and reduced the airspeed to 100 kt, closed the throttle and prepared for touchdown. He briefed his passenger to brace, gently rounded out and landed in the field. The aircraft remained upright and the pilot described how the aircraft came to a stop \u201csurprisingly quickly\u201d. The pilot and passenger vacated the cockpit unaided. The passenger suffered minor bruising and the pilot was uninjured. The aircraft sustained damage to its underside and propeller."

The fuel was then being drawn into the air flow, affecting the fuel air mixture, so the engine was running extremely rich. This directly resulted in the engine vibration and power loss."

These included being mindful of height in the cruise, to provide more time for decision making in the event of an emergency and avoiding overflying built up areas in a single engine aircraft. He described the benefits of performing practice forced landings on a regular basis. This was something he routinely did and also emphasised to students in his role as a flying instructor/class rating instructor."
