The aircraft was flown from Lydd Airport (also known as London Ashford Airport) and was
operating remotely when an electrical problem developed at the CU.  No issues were
reported with the functionality of the aircraft itself.
Mains power was provided to the communication and control systems through a UPS.  The
UPS was also equipped with a circuit breaker on its mains input and provides an audible
warning when no mains power is being supplied.

The onset of this event began when the UPS audible warning sounded due to the lack of
input mains power.  A petrol generator was started and connected to the UPS, but the UPS
indicated it was still not being supplied with mains electricity and had less than six minutes
of battery power remaining.  A “PAN” call was declared on the relevant ATC frequency.
A different UPS was acquired from an adjacent CU and a switch over of plugs and associated
extensions was carried out, but this process was hampered by a lack of labelling of what
each plug powered.  Sufficient power was restored to achieve a downgraded emergency
control 18 minutes after the onset of the event.  It was believed that full communication and
control capability could have been re-established, but it was decided not to risk disruption of
the adequate emergency control they had.  The “PAN” status was cancelled with ATC, and
the remote pilot manoeuvred the aircraft for an uneventful landing at Lydd.
The aircraft itself had highly automated capabilities to ensure it could return to base in
the event of a loss of link.  However, the aircraft was still receiving a communications link
‘heartbeat’, even though the control systems were not operational.  This caused it to simply
follow a holding pattern as it was configured to do.  This would have persisted until the
‘heartbeat’ was switched off or communications were re-established.
Operator’s investigation findings
Investigation by the operator established that the input power to the UPS had tripped and
is believed to have occurred when a laptop power supply was disconnected.  In hindsight, it
was realised that the external source of electrical mains power was still available and simply
resetting the UPS circuit breaker or bypassing the UPS and connecting the CU directly to
mains power or the petrol generator would have restored power to the necessary systems.
