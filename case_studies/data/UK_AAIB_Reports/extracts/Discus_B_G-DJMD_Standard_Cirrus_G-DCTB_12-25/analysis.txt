Overview
The pilots of G-DJMD and G-DCTB were participating in a local cross-country gliding
competition.  After crossing the Finish Ring, located 3 km from Hinton airfield, the accident
sequence began when the pilots, probably unaware of the presence of each other, flew on
converging tracks during their final approach.  The gliders collided above the intersection
of Runways 06 and 09.  The pilot of G-DCTB sustained serious injuries, while the pilot of
G-DJMD was fatally injured when his glider struck the ground.
Joining the circuit
The data recovered from both FLARM devices showed the gliders converged on the airfield
from different directions after completing their respective competition tasks.  G-DJMD
crossed the finish ring at 14:39:51 hrs at an altitude 2,300 ft (1,900 ft aal), while G-DCTB
crossed later, at 14:45:05 hrs, at a lower altitude of 1,400 ft (1,000 ft aal).  This initial height
and timing difference established a scenario where both aircraft would be joining a left-hand
circuit pattern, as directed at the competition briefing, at approximately the same time but
from different positions and altitudes.

The data showed that between t-45 and t-30 seconds before the collision, both gliders
appeared to be positioning for an approach to Runway 06 before G-DCTB turned left sharply.
G-DCTB’s track change, turning inside G-DJMD, could have been to avoid overflying the
village of Charlton or a decision to track directly to the airfield due to being at a height of
330 ft aal.  This manoeuvre, however, placed the two gliders on converging paths at t-15,
both at low altitude and with G-DCTB’s recorded ground speed 15 kph faster than G-DJMD’s.
Final manoeuvre
G-DCTB was observed to make a late turn toward Runway 09 17, deviating from what
appeared to be an intention to land on either Runway 06 (grass) or 06 (hard).  A ground
observer described G-DCTB’s final approach profile as “shallow”, with the airbrakes either
closed or only partially deployed.  This may indicate the pilot perceived he lacked sufficient
performance to reach Runway 06 and chose to turn towards Runway 09 to avoid landing
short.  Runway 09 (grass) was occupied with three gliders waiting to launch, which, once
recognised, would have required a larger track change to land on the disused concrete
Runway 09 instead.  The pilot could not recall which runway he had intended to land on.
Post-accident examination found G-DJMD’s airbrakes in the deployed position, while
G-DCTB’s were retracted.  This finding aligns with witness observations, although these
positions may have been affected by impact forces.
Some witnesses transposed the identity of the gliders in their statements to the AAIB.  This
was likely due to differing observation perspectives and a mental reconstruction based on
the gliders’ final positions on the ground, after the collision.
Engineering and collision geometry
Analysis of G-DCTB and G-DJMD’s structure and flying controls did not reveal any defects
or control restrictions that would have prevented either glider from being able to change
their flight path prior to the collision.
The right wingtip of G-DCTB contacted G-DJMD’s canopy frame and canopy transparency
in mid-air, causing the transparency to flex and fracture into multiple fragments.  The location
of the majority of G-DJMD’s canopy fragments were found at the beginning of the debris
field and paint transfer marks matching that of G-DCTB’s wingtip were found on G-DJMD’s
canopy frame and transparency.
The continued trajectory of the wingtip then made contact with the pilot of G-DJMD before
the wing’s leading edge struck the cockpit coaming, separating the top section of coaming
from the aircraft.  Heavy black markings on the leading edge, upper and lower surfaces of
G-DCTB’s right wing showed the coaming was in contact with the wing for some time as it
separated from G-DJMD.

The centre of G-DJMD’s left wing leading edge then struck G-DCTB’s right tailplane, leaving
a point impact mark on the wing’s leading edge and splitting the skin along its length.  The
tip of the tailplane separated and was found in the latter part of the debris field closest to
the accident site.
G-DJMD came to rest inverted, with its left wing underneath the top panel of G-DCTB’s right
air brake.  G-DCTB’s tail was in close proximity to G-DJMD’s nose and red paint transfer on
G-DJMD’s nose was matched to the lower rudder of G-DCTB, indicating this contact was
made during the latter accident sequence at ground level.
The main gear was found in retracted positions on both gliders.  The level of damage to
G-DCTB’s internal fuselage structure surrounding the gear wheel shows it is likely that
G-DCTB’s wheel was extended but pushed back up into the fuselage when it hit the ground.
It was not possible to accurately determine whether G-DJMD’s wheel had been extended.
Medical aspects and survivability
Due to the low height when the gliders collided, there was a negligible margin for the pilots
to have instigated avoiding or mitigating action, including use of parachutes.
Both pilots were wearing multi-point harnesses, which were effective in restraining them
in their seats, and it is probable that the energy-absorbing foam cushion fitted to G-DCTB
provided some additional vertical force impact protection to its pilot.
The report of the post-mortem examination of the pilot of G-DJMD revealed no evidence of
incapacitation before the accident.  The report stated that the pilot’s injuries were consistent
with the glider striking the ground inverted but noted that the possibility that the pilot was
injured to some extent during the collision could not be excluded.  Analysis of blood found
on G-DCTB’s right wingtip showed that it came into contact with the pilot during the initial
collision, but nothing more could be said about the extent of any injury sustained at that
point.  It was clear, however, that the accident sequence was not survivable for the pilot of
G-DJMD.
Lookout and visual acquisition
The collision occurred in VMC during daylight hours. The Met Office aftercast indicated
generally settled conditions with good visibility.  In these conditions, the primary method
of collision avoidance would have been visual lookout by both pilots.  Previous studies
have concluded that the effectiveness of unalerted see-and-avoid is challenging given the
‘limitations of the human visual and information processing system’ (Hobbs, 1991).
Both pilots had completed their competition tasks and were transitioning to the landing
phase, a period of high workload requiring simultaneous attention to multiple factors:
airspeed and flight path management, traffic awareness, selection of landing area, circuit
positioning and communication.  In such dynamic situations, pilots must decide where to
focus their attention and once established on final approach their focus shifts to executing
the landing, which reduces the time and attention available to monitor or detect the presence
of conflicting traffic.

Witness evidence and recorded data showed that the two gliders were on converging
flight paths at an angle of approximately 30°.  This created a challenging visual detection
scenario with the added possibility that cockpit structure and pilot seat positions may have
created blind spots.  It could not be determined whether the pilots received FLARM alerts
indicating the presence of the other glider, but no evasive manoeuvre was observed before
the collision and so the investigation concluded that neither pilot visually detected the other
glider in time to take effective avoiding action.
Glider radios
Both gliders were equipped with VHF radios tuned to the Hinton Radio frequency
(119.455 MHz), as confirmed during post-accident examination.  The radio from G-DJMD
was extensively damaged during the accident, had suffered from dirt ingress and some
corrosion was evident.  Subsequent testing confirmed that it was no longer able to transmit
or receive.  However, wiring continuity tests indicated that no faults were found on either
glider, therefore it is likely that the radio from G-DJMD was capable of transmitting and
receiving prior to the accident assuming a good power supply to the head unit.
G-DCTB’s radio passed all functional tests, indicating it was capable of both transmitting
and receiving at the time of the accident assuming a good power supply to the head unit.
Pilot communications
During the competition briefing, pilots were instructed to make position reports on downwind,
base leg and final approach.  The pilot of the parachute drop aircraft reported receiving a
response from a glider to his query regarding its landing intentions.  Shortly before the
collision, he heard another transmission that was “unintelligible”; he could not identify the
source or interpret its content.  It is possible that this was caused by two simultaneous
transmissions stepping on each other.
On the day of the accident, multiple witnesses monitoring the airfield’s frequency reported
significant shortcomings in radio discipline.  These included a lack of position reports and
a general pattern of weak, overlapping, and non-standard transmissions from gliders.
Excessive and unnecessary radio traffic further degraded clarity.
The operating environment at Hinton was inherently complex, with multiple runway
configurations and simultaneous gliding, parachuting, and powered aircraft operations.  This
required clear communication in accordance with the airfield’s published procedures and
competition briefing.  The accident pilots came from a club where visual scanning was the
primary method of collision avoidance, and radios were not routinely used for circuit position
calls.  This operational culture likely shaped their perception of radio communication as a
supplementary safety measure rather than an integral component of airfield procedures.
Consequently, under the increased cognitive workload during the transition from task
completion to landing, unfamiliar or non-standard radio procedures may have been assigned
a lower priority.

The AAIB concluded that effective communication was not established between the two
gliders in the critical moments leading up to the collision.  The underlying cause, whether
attributable to workload saturation, operating culture, or other human/technical factors,
could not be definitively identified.  However, it highlights the limitations of unalerted visual
acquisition as the primary means of collision avoidance, particularly in high-workload landing
phases.  It also emphasises the importance of pilot training and active encouragement to
use radios to alert other pilots to their position, especially in the circuit.
In recognition of the importance of making timely and accurate position calls in the circuit,
the following safety action was taken to strengthen the existing guidance on radio use:

The British Gliding Association:
 ● Sent an email to all club Chief Flying Instructors and BGA instructors
reminding them of the key attributes to avoid midair collisions during the
circuit, approach and landing.
 ● Updated the ‘Managing Flying Risk – Collision Avoidance’ section of their
website.
 ● Highlighted the updated collision avoidance information in their regular
e-newsletter to members.
The gliding club at Hinton Airfield produced an updated Daily Flying Briefing that
reminded members that:
 ● Radio checks are mandatory for the first flight of the day for club and private
gliders.
 ● Radio calls are mandatory for Downwind and Final to aid situational
awareness
The gliding club at Weston-on-the-Green Airfield amended its policy on the
requirement to make radio calls in the circuit.  Club instructors would teach
and encourage students and solo pilots to make a ‘downwind’ call when in the
circuit.  This would be reinforced during periodic check flights and promulgated
in the club’s weekly newsletter.
Flight Radiotelephony Operator’s Licence
In most situations, pilots operating an aeronautical radio installed in an aircraft are required
to hold a FRTOL.  There are some exceptions to this requirement, which are outlined in
Article 139 of the ANO 2016.
The BGA encourages and supports glider pilots in obtaining a FRTOL, acknowledging that
the training enhances confidence and broadens communication privileges, particularly for
pilots who fly cross-country.  However, for pilots who only fly locally from their home airfields,
26

 AAIB Bulletin:  G-DJMD and G-DCTB AAIB-30061
the BGA does not consider a FRTOL to be essential.  For this group of pilots, it is important
that they have a clear understanding of the requirements under the Wireless Telegraphy
Act 2006, and the ANO 2016.
To raise awareness of the FRTOL requirements, the CAA planned to issue a Safety Notice
and to update its website.  These actions would remind licence holders of the following
obligations:
‘The Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 and the Air Navigation Order 2016 requires
the Licensee of radio transmitting and receiving equipment installed in an aircraft
to hold an Aircraft Radio Licence.
The Licensee shall not permit any person to use the equipment unless they
hold a Flight Radiotelephony Operator’s Licence or act under the supervision of
a person who holds a Flight Radiotelephony Operator’s Licence issued by the
UK CAA.
There are some exceptions to the requirement to hold a Flight Radiotelephony
Operator’s Licence.  These are specified in Article 139 of the Air Navigation
Order 2016.
The service that is approved on the frequency allocation is what determines the
need for holding a FRTOL.  This is the published frequency allocation, which
unless it is notamed (or promulgated by other suitable appropriate means) as not
providing the published service or outside of the published hours this remains
the service which should be provided and therefore adhered to by those using
the frequency’.
Hinton airfield was licensed to operate an AGCS and neither of the accident pilots held a
FRTOL.
Airfield communications
Hinton airfield had been licensed to operate an AGCS since 1993, as indicated by the use of
the suffix ‘Radio’ in its callsign on both its website and the Pooleys Flight Guide chart.  The
Ofcom licence was renewed annually, and the use of the radio equipment and the service
provided were also subject to CAA approval under Article 205 of the Air Navigation Order on
first issue.  The approval was non-expiring and not subject to further oversight by the CAA.
An AGCS is required to provide traffic and weather information to pilots operating at, and
in the vicinity of, the airfield to assist decision making.  Where an AGCS is provided, it is
expected to be available during the airfield’s notified hours of operation.  All radio operators
transmitting on the frequency must hold an unrestricted ROCC.
The AAIB found that neither the licence holder, nor other organisations operating radios
transmitting on the allocated frequency at Hinton, had historically provided an AGCS.  The
licence holder believed the licence granted use of a dedicated frequency with the option,
rather than the obligation, of delivering an AGCS.  They considered this a safer alternative
27
All times are UTC©  Crown copyright 2025
 AAIB Bulletin:  G-DJMD and G-DCTB AAIB-30061
to giving up their known frequency and using Safetycom.  However, the airfield’s website
gave contradictory guidance to visiting pilots, advising them to ‘ Maintain a good listening
watch on Hinton Radio 119.45 which is a traffic frequency only’.
Because an AGCS was not provided, none of the personnel operating the base station or
mobile radios held an unrestricted ROCC.
The CAA advised the AAIB that an OPC, the only alternative form of aeronautical radio
station available, would not be approved at an airfield hosting visiting general aviation,
recreational flying and aircraft not operated by the company licensed to provide the OPC.
On the day of the accident, a single frequency (119.455 MHz) was used for communication
by all flying activities.  However, this frequency was not utilised to coordinate their combined
operations and instead operated primarily as a general recreational traffic channel.
Witnesses reported significant deficiencies in radio communications, including excessive
and unnecessary chatter and the use of non-standard phraseology.
Although it could not be determined with certainty that effective radio use would have
prevented the collision, a critical opportunity to detect and avoid the conflict at an earlier
stage was missed.  The investigation concluded that if an AGCS had been provided by a
qualified radio operator, all parties operating at Hinton would likely have benefitted from a
shared mental model and improved situational awareness, significantly improving overall
safety.
To support safe future operations at Hinton airfield, the CAA engaged in discussions with
the airfield’s owner and licence holder to establish a level of communication service suited
to their specific needs.
The CAA planned to update the contact details of all ANO Article 205 approval holders.
Once this process was complete, approval holders would be required to provide an up-to-
date list of all current ROCC holders authorised to provide an AGCS at their airfield.  This
must be maintained and made available to the CAA upon request.
The CAA also undertook to review the conditions associated with ANO Article 205 approvals,
as set out in the approval letter, to ensure they accurately reflected the responsibilities of
the approval holders.  Following this, the CAA intended to issue a Safety Notice and a
Supplementary Amendment to CAP 452 to communicate the changes.
