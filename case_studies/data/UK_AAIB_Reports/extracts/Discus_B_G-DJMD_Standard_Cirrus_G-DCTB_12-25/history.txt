The gliders were competing in an inter-club event at Hinton-in-the-Hedges Airfield.  The
competition involved navigating a fixed course task with designated turn points.  Pilots were
grouped into three categories: Novice, Intermediate, and Pundit.  The pilot of G-DJMD
competed in the Intermediate Class, tasked with a 156 km course, while the pilot of G-DCTB
was in the Novice Class, assigned a shorter route of 118 km.  The primary distinction
between classes was the course length.
Forecasts had indicated that the weather on the competition day might be unsuitable for
the planned activity.  However, while conditions proved better than expected on the day,
the organiser shortened the courses as a precaution1.  At 0900 hrs, the competition director

briefed all pilots on the weather forecast, task details, local airfield procedures, and safety
measures.  The pilots were instructed to make radio calls on the Hinton Radio 2 frequency,
reporting their positions on downwind, base leg and when turning final.  Hinton operations
included freefall parachuting, powered aircraft, and gliding activities.  Gliders were to launch
from Runway 09 (grass), with landings permitted on Runway 06 (grass or hard) (Figure 1),
or on Runway 09 (grass) if clear of launching gliders.  To avoid conflict with a parachute
drop aircraft, which was planned to operate throughout the day, glider pilots were directed
to fly left-hand circuits to the runways.  The drop aircraft flew right-hand circuits.

G-DJMD launched first at 1236 hrs, followed by G-DCTB at 1319 hrs.  The task sent the
gliders southwards on separate routes before eventually converging at Banbury, nine km to
the north-west of Hinton.  To complete the race the pilots had to cross a 3 km radius ‘finish
ring’ centred on Hinton, at or above 1,500 ft aal.  The radius encompassed likely landing
circuits, while the minimum altitude ensured sufficient height for manoeuvring to position to
land after finishing the task.

At 14:39:51 hrs G-DJMD crossed the finish ring west-north-west of Hinton at an altitude of
2,300 ft (1,900 ft aal).  G-DCTB crossed the ring to the west of Hinton at 14:45:05 hrs, at an
altitude of 1,400 ft (1,000 ft aal) ( Figure 2).  G-DJMD then descended in a series of orbits
near Farthinghoe, while G-DCTB continued briefly on a straight track, descending towards
Hinton, before turning north-east.  Both gliders then positioned on a downwind leg for a left-
hand circuit (Figure 3).
Figure 2
Relative positions of G-DJMD and G-DCTB as they positioned to join downwind
At approximately the same time, the pilot of the parachute drop aircraft, having despatched
his jumpers 3, positioned to join the circuit on right base for Runway 06 (hard).  When
descending through 800 ft on final, he observed a glider on a “tight left base” for Runway 06
just below his level.  He transmitted on the Hinton Radio frequency, “glider, are you going in
ahead of me?”, receiving the response, “I’m number one”.  The pilot acknowledged the radio
call and initiated a turn to the left to position behind the glider.  As he turned, he saw another
glider, that appeared to be aligned with Runway 09, slightly behind but level with the first.

gliders collided.

He reported hearing an “unintelligible transmission” on the radio then continued in a wide
left turn to position behind both gliders.  Upon re-establishing on final, he reported seeing
one glider’s wing “flip” , with the glider  rolling inverted over the threshold of the disused
Runway 09 before striking the ground.
A witness near the threshold of Runway 09 (grass) observed two gliders approaching the
airfield and was able to identify them by type.  G-DJMD was lined up with Runway 06 (grass)
and G-DCTB was slightly lower and ahead on a shallower approach profile, apparently
lined up with Runway 06 (hard).  As they approached the airfield boundary, G-DCTB made
a “shallow right turn” towards Runway 09 (grass), which was occupied with three  gliders
waiting to launch.  G-DCTB’s airbrakes were observed to be closed or partially closed.  The
manoeuvre placed G-DCTB on a conflicting path with G-DJMD.
The gliders collided at approximately 20 to 30 ft above the intersection of Runway 06 (hard)
and the disused Runway 09 threshold.  On collision, G-DJMD pitched up rapidly then rolled
right until inverted before striking the ground in an inverted attitude.  G-DCTB came to rest
upright but entangled with G-DJMD.
Another witness at the north-west of the airfield, some 250 m distant, observed an
approaching glider lined up with Runway 06 (grass) with its airbrakes open, and another
glider lined up with Runway 09 at an offset of approximately 30°.  They converged and
collided approximately 30 ft above the ground.  One glider pitched up, rolled inverted, then
pitched down, its canopy detaching before impact with the ground4.
Competitors and officials provided immediate assistance, followed promptly by emergency
services.  The pilot of G-DJMD suffered fatal injuries, while the pilot of G-DCTB sustained
serious injuries.
Accident site
Both gliders struck the ground at the western end of disused Runway 09.  G-DCTB came
to rest upright, facing across the runway to the right.  G-DJMD came to rest inverted, with
its nose close to the tail of G-DCTB, and its left wing leading edge lodged underneath the
airbrake cover of G-DCTB’s right wing.
A debris field of approximately 70 m preceded the gliders, beginning near the intersection
of Runway 06 and disused concrete Runway 09. The debris comprised pieces of canopy
transparency, instrument panel coaming, wingtip, aircraft skin, and personal effects.
Recorded information
FLARM data
Both G-DCTB and G-DJMD were equipped with FLARM installations, a traffic and collision
warning system, from which track data leading up to the accident were recovered for
both gliders.  Figure 3 shows these tracks, at a number of points in time, as the gliders
approached Hinton airfield, until the point that they collided.  Between t-15s and the last

data point, G-DCTB had a recorded ground speed 15 kph faster than G-DJMD.  Historical
data for each FLARM installation was checked using historical data, and this indicated both
units had a satisfactory detection range with no significant blind spots.

Radio tests
Both G-DCTB and G-DJMD were equipped with VHF radios.  These were recovered
from the wreckage and initially powered on at the AAIB to establish the last tuned radio
frequency before being sent to the manufacturer for detailed functional testing.  Both radios
were successfully powered-up and the last frequency tuned on both devices was found to
be 119.455 MHz, the frequency for Hinton-in-the-Hedges.  The radio from G-DJMD was
7
All times are UTC©  Crown copyright 2025
 AAIB Bulletin:  G-DJMD and G-DCTB AAIB-30061
extensively damaged during the accident, was internally contaminated with dirt, and some
of the circuitry had suffered corrosion, most likely following the accident; when tested at
the manufacturer’s facilities, it was unable to either receive or transmit a signal.  The radio
from G-DCTB was able to transmit and receive a signal and successfully passed all the
manufacturer’s functional tests.
The wiring from each radio head unit to its antenna was checked for electrical continuity, in
addition to checking the press-to-talk switches and loudspeakers.  No faults were found on
either glider.  The microphone from G-DCTB was also tested and found to function correctly,
but it was not possible to establish whether the microphone from G-DJMD worked because
it had been damaged.  The testing was limited to the radios themselves and did not include
their power supplies, which were not tested on site and which would have been somewhat
depleted subsequently.
Other avionics
G-DJMD was also fitted with a Kanardia EMSIS, an instrument used to provide the pilot
with an artificial horizon, speed and heading information.  This unit was disassembled, as it
records flight data including aircraft track and orientation, and several flights worth of data
were successfully retrieved from its onboard non-volatile memory.  However, the accident
flight was not recovered.  The manufacturer commented that a firmware update, to fix a
known issue with correctly recording the GPS date, had not been applied and that some of
the memory space reserved for recordings appeared corrupted; this may have affected the
recording of the accident flight.

Aircraft examination
G-DJMD
Fuselage and Canopy
G-DJMD had come to rest inverted.  The fuselage was intact and had abrasion damage
from contact with the runway surface.  The nose section had broken from top to bottom and
had red paint transfer on its left side.  There was further red paint transfer on the left side of
the canopy in two places.  The main gear wheel was found in the retracted position.
An upper section of composite instrument panel coaming was found approximately 45 m
prior to the fuselage, and the instrument panel was found adjacent to the glider.
The canopy transparency had fractured into many pieces, which were found scattered the
length of the debris field.  The canopy’s frame had broken in three places; at both front bend
points and at the top of the rear ‘hoop’.  The frame pieces were found next to the fuselage.
Tail
The tail section was intact but had been abraded from contact with the runway surface when
inverted.  The rudder pedal controls were connected to the rudder via cables and control
tubes, and there was control system continuity between the control stick and elevators.  All
control surfaces moved freely.
Wings
The left wing’s leading edge at its mid-span position was wedged underneath the air brake
cover on G-DCTB’s right wing upper surface.  Both wings were intact and had abrasion
damage from contact with the runway surface.  The right wing leading edge had a contact
damage point; from which the leading edge had split along its length.
Control system continuity was established between the control stick and the ailerons.  The
air brake lever could be rotated and moved fore and aft, but this did not move the air brakes
which were in the deployed position.
G-DCTB
Fuselage and Canopy
G-DCTB came to rest upright.  The tip of the nose had impact damage and the fuselage
frame behind the cockpit was distorted and cracked in a manner suggesting it was subject
to a hard upward force upon landing.  The main gear wheel was found in the retracted
position, likely from the landing force.  The sides of the cockpit area had also split from the
landing force.  The seat had come away from some of its mounting points but was intact.
The canopy frame was broken, and the canopy transparency had fractured. The majority of
the canopy pieces were found in the immediate vicinity of the fuselage.
10
All times are UTC©  Crown copyright 2025
 AAIB Bulletin:  G-DJMD and G-DCTB AAIB-30061
Tail
The glider’s tail boom structure was broken. The rudder control rod was intact and connected
at both ends, although bent and damaged where the tail boom was broken.  Control continuity
was established between the rudder pedals and the rudder.
The controls for the all-moving tailplane were intact and free to move from the control stick
to the break in the tail and were connected to the tailplane past the break.  The tip of the
left tailplane was missing and was in the preceding debris field approximately 8.5 m from
the fuselage.
Wings
The right wingtip had impact damage; a section of the underside wingtip skin had become
detached and was found approximately 40 m further back in the debris field (Figure 6).
Figure 6
G-DCTB right wingtip damage, and underside wingtip skin section
The right wing’s leading edge was covered with heavy black marking, that extended to both
upper and lower surfaces (Figure 7).

 AAIB Bulletin:  G-DJMD and G-DCTB AAIB-30061
Control continuity was established between the pilot’s control stick and the ailerons, and the
air brake lever and the air brakes.  Both connecting systems of control tubes and linkages
were subject to damage likely sustained on landing.  The air brakes were in the retracted
position.
Survivability
Both pilots wore parachutes; there is no regulation covering the use of emergency
parachutes although there is a BGA Operational Regulation that requires glider occupants to
carry emergency parachutes when flying in cloud and their use is considered a reasonable
precaution.  The proximity of the gliders to the ground when they collided would have
precluded safe and effective use of a parachute in this situation.
G-DJMD was equipped with a five-point harness, and G-DCTB was equipped with a four-
point harness.  Both pilots were wearing these correctly and the pilots were effectively
restrained in their seats.  G-DJMD struck the ground inverted; despite the harness, this
circumstance was not survivable.
Both gliders had a separate, locally manufactured, high-density foam seat cushion.  In
G-DJMD it was located underneath the seat, and in G-DCTB it was on top of the seat.  It
is probable that the cushion provided an additional level of impact protection to the pilot
of G-DCTB, although it was not possible to quantify by how much.  The BGA provides
information on the benefits of using energy-absorbing cushions in gliders to help protect
the spine5.
Meteorology
An aftercast provided by the Met Office described the prevailing conditions on the day of
the accident:
‘The afternoon of the 25th of May, would see generally settled conditions across
much of the UK, including the area of interest.  A frontal system, with associated
precipitation would be affecting the East Midlands and East Anglia, with another
system moving into the Southwest
The area of interest was sandwiched between those two frontal systems and
looking at a variety of sites surrounding the area, the conditions could be
described as settled with light southeasterly winds, visibility in excess of 10 km,
with cloud bases around 4000 to 4500 ft’’.
Photographs provided to the AAIB by witnesses showed conditions at Hinton airfield on the
afternoon of 25 May 2024 that confirmed the Met Office analysis.

Aeronautical radio stations
The CAA publishes CAP 452, ‘ Aeronautical Radio Station Operator’s Guide’ 6, which is
intended to provide the main reference document for aeronautical radio station operators.
It presents two levels of communication service that might be appropriate for an unlicensed
airfield with a dedicated frequency: an Air Ground Communication Service (AGCS) and an
Operational Control Communication (OPC) Service.
AGCS
Where an AGCS is provided,
‘radio station operators provide traffic and weather information to pilots operating
on and in the vicinity of the aerodrome. Such traffic information is based primarily
on reports made by other pilots. Information provided by an AGCS radio station
operator may be used to assist a pilot in making a decision; however, the safe
conduct of the flight remains the pilot’s responsibility’.
When provided, an ‘AGCS is to be made available to aircraft during notified hours’.
OPC
An OPC is an,
‘…aeronautical radio station which is licensed and established for company
operational control communications.  It may be used only for communication
with company aircraft, or aircraft for which the company is the operating agency’.
On their website 7, the CAA states that the category of OPC also includes all areas of
recreational aviation, including:
‘…associations, clubs, societies and individuals operating gliders, hang gliders,
para gliders, paramotors, microlights, parachutes, balloons, gyroplanes and
simple single engine aeroplanes’.
where,
‘Aeronautical radio stations, comprising fixed, mobile, portable and hand-held
radio equipment, are typically established and operated by these clubs, societies
and individuals to provide radio communications with aircraft for the exchange
of messages related to the particular recreational aviation activity’.
However, the CAA clarified that this service cannot be used for visiting general aviation,
recreational aviation and other aircraft which are not operated by the company licensed to
provide the OPC service.

Airfield information
Hinton-in-the-Hedges is an unlicensed airfield located approximately 4 km west of Brackley,
Northamptonshire, at an elevation of 505 ft amsl (Figure 8).  It is owned and operated by a
private company.
Figure 8
Hinton-in-the Hedges Airfield (© Pooleys, 2023)
Airfield operations
The airfield accommodates a gliding club, a skydiving operator, and several private aircraft
owners.  To ensure effective deconfliction of gliding and parachuting activities, the airfield
Operations Agreement sets out a process in which the Duty Instructor of the gliding club
liaises with the parachute Drop Zone Controller prior to operations.  During this meeting,
separate operating areas are established.  Annotated maps reflecting these arrangements
are signed by all relevant parties, disseminated within their respective organisations, and
displayed at the airfield fuel pumps for other airfield users.
Should operational circumstances require any amendment to these arrangements, all
signatories are notified and the maps are updated.  The amendments must be signed by
the involved parties prior to the continuation of activities.
This process was followed on the day of the accident.

Airfield communication
Hinton Airfield’s Aeronautical Station Radio Licence, for an AGCS, was first issued in
May 1993 by the Office of Communication (Ofcom) under the Wireless Telegraphy Act and
had been renewed annually.  The original allocated frequency was 119.450 MHz, with the
callsign ‘Hinton Radio’.  In 2018, this was amended to 119.455 MHz to comply with the
transition from 25 kHz to 8.33 kHz channel spacing.  The use of the radio equipment and the
service provided were subject to approval by the CAA under Article 205 of the Air Navigation
Order8.  The approval was non-expiring after initial issue and not subject to further oversight
by the CAA.
The skydiving operator used a radio base station to communicate with their drop aircraft,
while the gliding club used handheld radios to coordinate gliding activities.  All radios
operated on the frequency 119.455 MHz.  Hinton airfield users routinely used the callsign
‘Hinton Traffic’ for radio calls, although the approved callsign suffix for an AGCS is ‘Radio’.
The entry in Pooleys Flight Guide for Hinton airfield had been annotated with the callsign
‘Hinton Radio’ (Figure 8) since 1993.
Radio callsigns typically comprise the airfield’s geographical location followed by a suffix
to identify the type of service pilots are receiving .  The suffix ‘Traffic’ is associated with the
Safetycom frequency (135.480 MHz), which is reserved for use at unattended aerodromes
without an allocated frequency.  Safetycom does not provide an air traffic service and is not
linked to any aeronautical ground station; its main purpose is to enable pilots to communicate
their intentions to other aircraft operating at or near the aerodrome9.

Following a fatal accident in 2002, in which a glider collided with a freefall parachutist at
Hinton10, the airfield owner implemented enhanced radio procedures to improve on-airfield
communications.  This included mandating radios for all users and requiring position calls
in the circuit.  The airfield’s website stated under ‘terms of use’:
‘Hinton is an unlicensed airfield, therefore Unlicensed Rules apply.
Maintain a good listening watch on Hinton Radio 119.45
which is a traffic frequency only.
Normal “Arrival, Circuit & Departure” radio calls to be made to
“Hinton Traffic”. Do not expect a reply’.
Although the owner had held an AGCS licence since 1993, they mistakenly believed, or
had been incorrectly advised, that providing the service was optional and that they could
operate as a recreational service using the dedicated frequency for traffic radio calls.  During
annual licence renewals, Ofcom advised that it was a condition of the Wireless Telegraphy

Act 2006 that where the licensee of an aeronautical station was providing a service approved
under the ANO, the station must be operated in accordance with that approval.  Despite
the licence terms, the owner prioritized retaining their established frequency, citing safety
concerns over “downgrading” to a general frequency if the licence terms were amended and
they reverted to Safetycom.
The AAIB found that although Ofcom had issued an Aeronautical Station Radio Licence for
an AGCS at Hinton since 1993, and the CAA had approved its operation under Article 205
of the ANO, the licence holder – and other organisations using the allocated frequency -
had never provided a level of service fully compliant with the ANO approval and CAP 452
standards.
Radio operators
Article 202 of the ANO 11 requires that radio operators transmitting on an AGCS frequency
must hold an unrestricted Radio Operator’s Certificate of Competence (ROCC), issued by
the CAA and approved by the licence holder.  Personnel transmitting on the Hinton Radio
base station used by the skydiving operator to communicate with the drop aircraft, and
handheld radios used by the gliding club to manage their activity, did not hold unrestricted
ROCCs.
One radio operator held a Parachute Radio Operator’s Certificate of Competence
(Restricted) which allows transmission on only two frequencies allocated to the British
Parachute Association (BPA)12: one for communication between the drop zone control and
the drop aircraft, a second between drop zone control and parachutists.  Neither of those
frequencies were used at Hinton.
Pilots
It is a requirement in most circumstances when operating an aeronautical radio for pilots to
hold a Flight Radiotelephony Operator Licence (FRTOL).  Glider pilots and student pilots
under training are, subject to certain conditions, exempt from the requirement to hold a
FRTOL under Article 139 of the Air Navigation Order 2016.  However, glider pilots without
a FRTOL are not permitted to use the radio to communicate with an air traffic control unit,
flight information unit or an AGCS.  The level of service that is approved on the published
frequency allocation is what determines the need for holding a FRTOL.
Neither of the pilots involved in the accident held a FRTOL.

Radio communications on the day of the accident
Multiple witnesses, in a position to monitor radio transmissions, consistently reported
deficiencies in radio communication on the day of the accident.  Notably, several witnesses
reported that they did not hear any radio calls from the accident pilots indicating their
intentions.  The pilot of G-DCTB recalled that he made a downwind radio call, but not if he
made a call on base or final.  This difficulty in recall was likely due to the serious injuries
sustained in the accident.
Radio transmissions from some glider pilots participating in the competition were variously
described as “non-standard”, with “weak signals” and instances of overlapping transmissions
with pilots “stepping on each other ”.  Excessive and “unnecessary radio chatter” was
observed, further contributing to communication difficulties.  One witness recalled a single
intelligible call, possibly from a glider, reporting its position on left base for Runway 06;
subsequent transmissions were unreadable.
Despite Hinton airfield’s requirement for clear radio communication, necessitated by the
presence of parachutists, powered aircraft and gliders, one witness observed a lack of
radio discipline among glider pilots.  This was characterised by inconsistent, or absent
transmissions.
Witness testimony
All witnesses observing the event from the airfield described the collision sequence in
broadly similar terms.  They were positioned at various locations: near the threshold of
Runway 09 (grass), the disused concrete Runway 09, north-west of the airfield near the fuel
pumps (Figure 8), and to the north near the parachute centre.  Some viewed the event from
inside vehicles.
While not all witnesses specifically identified the gliders, some referred to them by their
competition numbers and others by type.  The main difference in testimony was the gliders’
relative positions as they approached the runways:
 ● G-DCTB approaching Runway 09; G-DJMD approaching Runway 06.
 ● G-DJMD approaching Runway 09; G-DCTB approaching Runway 06.
The pilot of G-DCTB could not recall which runway he had intended to use or was ultimately
lined up with.
Organisational information
British Gliding Association (BGA) guidance on radio use
The BGA is the governing body for gliding in the UK and provides comprehensive information
and guidance for glider pilots, including on radio use, under the ‘ Managing Flying Risk ’
section of its website 13.  The BGA advises that radios, when used correctly,  enhance

situational awareness, especially for communicating aircraft positions in the circuit.  The
use of radios has been encouraged, but not mandated, and is largely delegated to gliding
clubs to decide local policy.
BGA position on FRTOLs
The BGA supports the established position that glider pilots are not legally required to
hold a FRTOL when communicating on allocated gliding frequencies, provided they do not
communicate with Air Traffic Service Units or an AGCS.  However, a FRTOL is necessary for
communication with these services or when operating outside designated gliding channels.
The BGA advises that FRTOL training builds confidence and expands communication
privileges, such as contacting controllers, accessing Radio Mandatory Zones, controlled
airspace, and aerodrome traffic zones.  This training is especially encouraged for pilots who
regularly fly cross-country, with approximately 150 glider pilots completing FRTOL courses
with the BGA annually in recent years.
However, for pilots who only fly locally from their airfields, the BGA does not consider a
FRTOL to be necessary.  It believes that training time would be more effectively used by
focusing on circuit call procedures, rather than on aspects of aviation covered in the FRTOL
course that are not relevant to this group of pilots.
Alignment with Part SFCL
The BGA Gliding Certificate transitioned to the requirement for all Part 21 Sailplane Pilots
to operate with the CAA-issued Part SFCL (Sailplane Flight Crew Licensing) SPL (Sailplane
Pilots Licence) from 30 September 2025. The training syllabus and Bronze Award exams

Airfield frequencies for gliding clubs
In October 2022 the BGA gave a presentation to the CAA to support their call for a greater
allocation of discrete radio frequencies for gliding clubs.  The BGA argued that CAA policy,
which requires airfield operators to deliver an AGCS to qualify for a discrete radio frequency,
was inappropriate and potentially unsafe for gliding operations.  The BGA highlighted that
gliding clubs often experience unpredictable and dense traffic patterns, with many gliders
simultaneously airborne and circuit activity that differs significantly from typical general
aviation airfields.  They believed that as direct pilot-to-pilot communication was essential
for effective deconfliction, delivering an AGCS would be impractical and may even reduce
safety at gliding clubs.  Furthermore, the BGA argued that many clubs have a high volume
of annual movements, justifying the need for their own discrete frequencies to prevent the
overlap of radio calls with neighbouring airfields.
The BGA proposed two main solutions: allowing clubs to apply for discrete frequencies without
the AGCS requirement or increasing the number of Common Glider Field Frequencies from
the current two and permitting the BGA to manage them.  The CAA allocated an additional
10 common frequencies, which were distributed to 30 gliding clubs and became operational
in February 2024.

Aircraft visibility
See-and-avoid
The pilot of G-DCTB recalled seeing the parachute drop aircraft in the distance while
conducting his pre-landing checks.  However, he did not recall being aware of, or seeing,
G-DJMD, even during the manoeuvre recorded at t-120 seconds prior to collision when
recorded data showed his glider positioning behind, and 420 ft above, G-DJMD to establish
on a downwind leg.
An ATSB report into a fatal midair collision between two sightseeing helicopters on the Gold
Coast of Australia in 202314 examined the effectiveness of unalerted see-and-avoid where
pilots rely on visually acquiring other aircraft and then taking action to avoid them.  The
report highlights the extensive literature documenting the limitations of see-and-avoid.  In
particular, an ATSB research report (Hobbs, 1991 15) stated that unalerted see-and-avoid
is a ‘Last resort separation if other methods fail to prevent a confliction, regardless of the
nature of the airspace’.
The report outlines the steps involved in see-and-avoid:
1. The pilot looks outside the aircraft.
2. The pilot searches the visual field and detects objects of interest, often in
peripheral vision.
3. The object must be directly observed and identified as an aircraft.
4. If identified as a collision threat, the pilot must decide on evasive action.
5. The pilot must then execute the necessary control movements and allow
the aircraft to respond.
The report provides context for these steps:
‘Not only does the whole process take valuable time, but human factors at
various stages in the process can reduce the chance that a threat aircraft will
be seen and successfully evaded. These human factors are not ‘errors’ nor are
they signs of ‘poor airmanship’. They are limitations of the human visual and
information processing system which are present to various degrees in all pilots’
In contrast, alerted see-and-avoid augments the task of visual acquisition by directing pilots
to the location of other aircraft, either through timely and accurate radio position reports or
aircraft-based alerting systems such as FLARM.

In its report on the fatal midair collision between gliders G-KADS and G-CLXG in 202316, the
AAIB noted that while systems such as FLARM can provide timely information about other
similarly equipped aircraft, they remain an aid to pilot lookout.  The report cautioned:
‘It is possible that pilots who experience repeated alerts or alarms from aircraft
systems can begin to disregard or pay less attention when they sound even if
those alerts are genuine’.
The investigation could not determine whether the pilots of G-DJMD and G-DCTB received
any FLARM alerts while positioning in the circuit at Hinton.
Tests and research
Paint and surface analysis
Forensic sampling and analysis of paint transfer marks was carried out on both gliders.  Red
paint from the bottom of G-DCTB’s rudder was chemically matched to paint transfer marks
on the forward, left fuselage surface of G-DJMD.  Red paint from G-DCTB’s right wingtip
was chemically matched to paint transfer on the left rear section of G-DJMD’s canopy frame.
Forensic analysis of a section of skin from the lower surface of G-DCTB’s right wingtip
positively identified the presence of blood from the pilot of G-DJMD, and so it was concluded
that the wing came into contact with the pilot during the collision.
Canopy failure analysis
The majority of both canopies were retrieved from the accident site, and both were
reconstructed.  Fracture surface analysis was conducted on fragments from the left-hand
rear section of G-DJMD’s canopy transparency.
The analysis showed visible ‘scarp’ features (feather patterns) typical of brittle fracture on the
edges of the fragments.  This indicates the canopy failed from being distorted, rather than
from an impact load.  There was evidence of red paint transfer on fracture surfaces of two of
the fragments (Figure 9) which were retrieved from the farthest part of the debris field.

Crack initiation was likely to have been from at or near the window aperture, running through
an area of red paint deposit.  The fracture direction ran aft and upwards, before returning
to the front of the canopy (Figure 10).  The two areas of red paint transfer indicate pressure
being broadly applied to the canopy between these points before the canopy flexed and
broke, and the paint was then able to transfer onto the fracture surfaces.

Surface transfer testing
Surface transfer testing was performed between G-DJMD’s composite coaming material
and the wing surface of G-DCTB.  This produced a similar marking pattern to that seen on
both upper and lower wing surfaces and the leading edge of the right wing.
Pilot information
Pilot experience
Both the pilot of G-DJMD and the pilot of G-DCTB held BGA Gliding Certificates with
Bronze and Cross-Country endorsements and a Silver Badge.  This entitled the pilots to
hold a Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI) competition licence.  Both pilots had
previously flown in competitions and both held a BGA Basic Instructor rating.

Use of radios at home airfield
The pilots’ home airfield was RAF Weston-on-the-Green, used primarily for military parachute
training.  The airfield is a large grass site with three landing strips.  The airfield operator did
not allow gliding activity when parachute operations were active.
The gliding club used a Common Glider Field Frequency but did not mandate the making
of position calls in the circuit.  A witness told the AAIB that it would have been “unusual” for
the accidents pilots to make position calls in the circuit at Weston.
The pilot of G-DCTB had flown out of Weston since his initial flying training in 2021.  The
pilot of G-DJMD joined the club in 2021, already qualified with a cross-country endorsement
and a Silver Badge.
Medical
Both pilots had registered CAA Pilot Medical Declarations which met the requirements of
the BGA for pilots in command.
Post-mortem report
Post-mortem examination of the pilot of G-DJMD revealed no evidence of incapacitation
before the accident and recorded the cause of death as ‘ head injury’ .  The pathologist
commented that:
‘There were no injuries identified that would not be explained by [a glider striking
the ground inverted], however, the possibility that some injury was sustained as
a result of the initial canopy impact cannot be entirely excluded on pathological
examination alone’.
