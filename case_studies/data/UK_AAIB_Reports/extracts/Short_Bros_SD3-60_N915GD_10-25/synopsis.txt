On arrival at Terrance B Lettsome International Airport (TUPJ) in the British Virgin Islands, 
N915GD was likely affected by nearby thunderstorm activity, reportedly experiencing a 
downdraught on short finals.  Despite the commander applying more power to “arrest the 
descent”, the aircraft initially touched down on the lip of Runway 07 (Rwy 07), approximately 
150 m short of the threshold.  It then bounced and touched down again close to the threshold.  
The airfield operations team later found a frangible runway light had been damaged by the 
aircraft when it undershot the runway.  
While he knew the aircraft initially touched down in the undershoot, the commander was 
unaware that it had struck the light and did not file an occurrence report.  The aircraft 
returned to its home base approximately one hour later.
An initial incorrect assessment of the severity of this incident, contributed to a delay in 
this serious incident being notified to the AAIB.  This delay, combined with a paucity of 
information about the circumstances and handling of the event, made it difficult for the 
investigation to gain a detailed understanding of what had happened.  It is unclear whether 
the undershoot resulted from the commander attempting to rescue an unstable approach or 
whether his application of power was the initiation of an unsuccessful go-around.
