This was a reportable serious incident resulting from an unstable approach in the vicinity of 
CB activity which had been forecast for N915GD’s arrival time at TUPJ.  While the Met Office 
was unable to find definitive evidence of it affecting the airfield, turbulence and windshear 
could be expected near an active CB cell.
The initial severity assessment of incident, rather than serious incident, resulted in delayed 
notification to the AAIB.  This delay, combined with a paucity of information about the 
circumstances and handling of the event made it difficult for the investigation to gain a 
detailed understanding of what transpired.  It is unclear whether the commander attempted 
to rescue the unstable approach or whether his application of power was the initiation of an 
unsuccessful go-around.
