During an airfield inspection at TUPJ, which began at 1900 hrs Z on 6 November, it was
found that a frangible light at the western edge of the Rwy 07 undershoot was missing.  Tyre
marks were also discovered on the extreme end of the runway.  Based on the nature of the
marks, their orientation and location, as well as the track between them, it was determined
they were made by an aircraft rather than a ground vehicle (Figure 1).  The airfield
boundary fence in the Rwy 07 undershoot had also sustained damage.  The barbed wire
support arm on one fence pole was missing and the wire had been severed in that location
(Figures 1 & 2).

The body and shattered lens from the missing runway light were found at the edge of
taxiway Alpha (Figure 3).

To determine how the damage might have occurred, the airfield authorities reviewed CCTV
footage from 6 November.  They found that when N915GD made its approach to Rwy 07 at
1854 hrs Z it initially touched down in the undershoot at the edge of the runway pavement,
bounced once and then landed off its second touchdown (Figure 4).

The commander was aware the aircraft had touched down short of the threshold but did not
realise it had struck the runway light in the process.  No damage was observed during the
turnaround and the aircraft then flew back to its base at San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Safety reporting
With damage to airfield infrastructure having been found, the airfield duty manager submitted
a Mandatory Occurrence Report (MOR) to Air Safety Support International (ASSI) on
9 November 2024.  In the MOR, the event type was recorded as ‘ Incident.’  Following a
review of the report, ASSI reclassified the event as a Serious Incident and notified the AAIB
on 6 January 2025.
Unaware that the aircraft had struck any obstacles on the approach, the flight crew did
not submit a safety report about the landing but provided the following brief statement on
8 November 2024 in response to the TUPJ airfield authorities’ enquiries.
‘On November 6 the weather was marginal with rain on all quadrants, upon
approaching runway 7 on short final started to experience wind gusts and
probably a downdraft [sic], seemed close to a low-level wind shear.  Applied
power to arrest the descent.  I landed slightly short of the numbers.  I was totally
unaware that I struck [anything].’
Although they were requested from the commander, further details of the occurrence,
which could have provided greater insight into the content and context of their 8 November
statement, were not provided to the AAIB.
ICAO Annex 13 (Aircraft Accident and Incident Investigation) Attachment C lists typical
examples of incidents that are likely to be classified as serious.  This list includes:
‘Take-off or landing incidents. Incidents such as under-shooting, overrunning or
running off the side of runways.’
The operator did not instigate an internal safety review for this serious incident.
Personnel
The commander did not supply the investigation with details of their flight licence, medical
status, flying experience or recency.
Meteorology
The reports submitted to the AAIB did not contain meteorological information, but the UK
Met Office generated a limited aftercast for the time of the serious incident.  The report
found that:
 ● The weather conditions on the day were characterised by light east to north
easterly winds with scattered cloud.
 ● There was no indication, in the TAF or FIR Forecast of any low-level

turbulence, except for that which might be expected in the vicinity of
convective clouds such as cumulonimbus (CB).
 ● The TUPJ TAF included a risk of thunderstorms from 1800 hrs UTC, with an
associated forecast reduction in visibility and cloud bases.
 ● The reported intensity of the rainfall at the airfield along with the number of
lightning strikes recorded on the weather radar imagery at Figure 5 indicated
an active CB cell was over or close to the territory at the time of the serious
incident.
 ● There was no indication of any significant wind shear in association with the
thunderstorms, but the Met Office did not have access to the full record of
wind speed or direction.

Aircraft examination
The flight crew did not notice any aircraft damage on the turnaround at TUPJ.  During
maintenance action after the return flight ‘marks of contact’ were found on the left mainwheel
tyre which required it to be removed and replaced.  The operator did not identify any other
airframe damage.

Airfield description
TUPJ has a single runway with displaced thresholds at either end.  The paved undershoot
for Rwy 07 is approximately 150 m long, after which the ground falls away across a public
road and rocky shoreline to the sea.  The distance between the paved surface and the
sea is approximately 25 m and the reported touchdown elevation is 14 ft (Figure 6).  As it
passes through the undershoot, the top of the airfield perimeter fence is below the level of
the paved runway surface.

The Rwy 07 PAPIs are set for a 3.5° final approach.
The runway chart for TUPJ alerts pilots to occasional windshear on the approach to Rwy 07
when the winds are from the south and south-east.
