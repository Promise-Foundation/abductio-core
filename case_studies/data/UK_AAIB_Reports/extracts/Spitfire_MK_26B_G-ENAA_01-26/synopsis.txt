The aircraft yawed left during the takeoff roll, pitched up rapidly and once airborne rolled 
rapidly to the left.  The left wingtip struck the ground and the aircraft came to rest inverted 
and caught fire.  The pilot was fatally injured.  The investigation found that the aircraft most 
probably stalled during the rapid pitch up and that the ensuing left roll and yaw occurred as 
a result of a post-stall autorotation.
Examination of the aircraft, while limited to some extent by the disruption caused by the 
impact and fire, did not reveal any technical defects which may have adversely affected the 
controllability of the aircraft.
No definitive cause was established for the loss of control.
