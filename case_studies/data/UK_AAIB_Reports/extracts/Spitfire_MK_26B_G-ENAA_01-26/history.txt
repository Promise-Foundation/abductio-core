Two members of the syndicate that owned the aircraft drove to Enstone Airfield together 
on the morning of the accident.  They arrived at approximately 1000 hrs and moved the 
aircraft out of its hangar.  The surviving syndicate member described the pre-flight checks 
as “all good.”  That pilot boarded the aircraft and taxied out at approximately 1200 hrs.  He 
conducted a general handling flight in the local area for 30 minutes, during which there were 
no technical issues with the aircraft.  He parked the aircraft near point B (Figure 1) for the 
crew change.

The first pilot had flown with the aircraft seat in its most aft position.  During the crew change 
the pilots worked together to move the seat to the middle position of the three available.  The 
seat was secured in that position with pip pins.  The first pilot opened the engine cowling 
to check for leaks and stated that none were found.  He then helped the second pilot strap 
into the seat’s four-point harness.  The second pilot then started the aircraft and taxied to 
position A (Figure 1) where he was seen to do the engine run up checks.  He then lined up 
for takeoff on tarmac Runway 26 (shown in black in Figure 1).
The initial part of the takeoff roll seemed normal and the aircraft tailwheel lifted as expected.  
The tail then lowered to the ground and the aircraft yawed left towards the edge of the 
tarmac runway.  As it approached the edge of the tarmac, the aircraft pitched up sharply and 
then rolled rapidly to the left.  The left wingtip struck the ground, with approximately 120 ° 
of bank angle, followed by the nose.  Immediately after the nose struck the ground a large 
fire broke out causing extensive further damage to the aircraft.  The pilot was fatally injured.
Accident site 
The aircraft came to rest at the southern edge of the south side grass Runway 26, 
approximately 45 m from the edge of tarmac Runway 26.  The ground marks showed 
that the left wingtip struck the ground first, followed by the propeller and engine.  Distinct 
propeller strikes on the ground indicated propeller rotation at the time of impact.  The impact 
sequence was dynamic, with the right wing then striking the ground before the aircraft 
came to rest inverted.  An intense post-crash fire, centred on the cockpit, caused extensive 
damage to the central part of the aircraft and engine bay.

Recorded information
Recorded information included closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage from two cameras 
located on the airfield’s control tower and a video recording made by a witness using a 
mobile phone (Figure 2).  The combined footage captured the aircraft as it taxied to the 
runway, the takeoff run, and subsequent takeoff through to the aircraft striking the ground.  
A recording of the radio communications between the pilot and airfield radio operator was 
also available.
Photogrammetry in conjunction with laser scan data of the accident site and of another 
Spitfire 26B was used to extrapolate G-ENAA’s approximate speed, heading, pitch and roll 
angle during the accident takeoff.  Smoothing algorithms were applied to the derived speed 
of the aircraft due to the varying quality of the recorded images.  Because of this, values for 
speed are only an approximate indication.
Other potential sources of data, such as the pilot’s mobile phone and the aircraft’s MoTeC 
SDL3 instrument logger fitted in the cockpit were destroyed in the fire.

Taxi and takeoff
The aircraft commenced taxiing towards Runway 26 at 1251:25 hrs from its parked position 
adjacent to the control tower.  It taxied along the grass parking area to taxi point A, where 
it stopped short of the runway.  The aircraft then remained stationary, consistent with pre-
takeoff checks being performed, before the pilot transmitted at 1256:37 hrs that he was ready 
for departure.  The flaps could be seen to be deployed but it was not possible at this point 
in the recordings to confirm their position.  The radio operator advised that the surface wind 
was from 220° at 5 kt, which the pilot acknowledged; no further radio transmissions were 
received from the pilot.  The wind direction and speed were consistent with the recorded 
footage of the airfield’s windsock captured by the CCTV and witness video recordings.  The 
aircraft then taxied to the runway where it was aligned to the right of the runway’s centre 
line (Figure 3).  At 1257:23 hrs the pilot commenced the takeoff run and the aircraft started 
to accelerate.
Figure 3
Aircraft at start of takeoff run 
When the aircraft’s airspeed reached approximately 45 kt, the tail of the aircraft lifted to an 
almost horizontal attitude (Figure 4), which coincided with a brief left rudder input, and the 
aircraft yawed to the left.  The elevator could then be observed to move to a pitch up (control 
surface up) position, which was near to its full travel position, and the tail of the aircraft 
quickly lowered back towards the runway (Figure 5).  The elevator remained in a pitch-up 
position, whilst the tailwheel tyre bounced on and off the runway surface several times.  The 
aircraft’s weight then settled on the tail wheel, which was almost coincident with the main 
landing gear tyres leaving the runway surface (Figure 6).

 AAIB Bulletin:  G-ENAA AAIB-30237
As the aircraft passed the witness’s position, the pilot’s head could be seen to be in an 
upright position and facing forward.  At this point in the recording it was also possible to 
see that the flaps had been extended to about 10 ° and the elevator trim tab was set to 
approximately its mid-travel nose-up (surface down) position1.
The aircraft continued to head towards the left side of the runway with the main wheels 
just clear of the runway surface whilst the tailwheel remained in contact (Figure 7).  The 
aircraft’s pitch attitude was about 12 ᵒ nose-up.  As the aircraft reached the side of the 
runway its airspeed was approximately 63 kt and it pitched up quickly at a rate of about 
12ᵒ/s and started to climb (Figure 8).  The elevators could then be seen to move quickly to 
a more neutral position.  The pitch attitude reached just over 20ᵒ and the data indicated that 
the aircraft’s airspeed reduced to approximately 58 kt.  The aircraft then started rolling left, 
with a slight reduction in its pitch attitude to about 18ᵒ nose-up (Figure 9).
The aircraft’s ailerons were then observed to move to a right roll position (left aileron surface 
down / right aileron surface up) (Figure 10) but the aircraft continued rolling left.  The footage 
of the aircraft captured by the witness ended shortly after this point but the continuing flight 
path of the aircraft was recorded by one of the CCTV cameras (Figure 11).  When the 
aircraft’s bank angle reached about 30 ᵒ, its pitch attitude briefly stabilised at about 15 ᵒ  
nose-up but as the bank angle reached about 40 ᵒ the roll rate increased quickly to about 
70ᵒ/s.  The aircraft’s nose started to drop and the aircraft descended, with the bank angle 
reaching about 120ᵒ before the aircraft struck the ground, left wingtip first, at 1257:40 hrs.
The time interval from the start of the takeoff run to the aircraft striking the ground was about 
17 seconds with the aircraft reaching a maximum height of approximately 30 ft agl.  The 
rudder, elevators and ailerons could all be seen to have been moving during periods of the 
video footage and both flaps appeared symmetrically deployed.
Engine and propellor speed
The mobile phone recording contained sounds consistent with the operation of the aircraft’s 
engine.  This showed that at the start of the takeoff run the engine speed was about  
2,000 rpm, and that the engine rpm was then progressively increased to a maximum of 
about 4,300 rpm; this equated to a propellor speed 2 of about 2,360 rpm.  The recording 
indicated that this engine speed was maintained as the aircraft took off through to the 
aircraft subsequently striking the ground.  There was no audible evidence of a problem with 
the engine, such as it backfiring.
Separate analysis using photogrammetry was also consistent with the propellor speed of 
about 2,360 rpm.
Footnote
1 The position of the flaps and pitch trim tab were established by comparing the images from the witness video 
recording with another Spitfire 26B with its flaps and trim tab set at known positions.
2 A reduction ratio of 1.82 between the engine speed and propellor speed is applied through gearing (ie an 
engine speed of 1,820 rpm = propellor speed of 1,000 rpm).

an almost identical position as the accident video recording made by the witness.  During 
the takeoff run, the tail of the aircraft had lifted to a near horizontal position which was 
maintained as the aircraft took off.  Audio analysis of the video indicated that the engine 
speed reached about 4,400 rpm during the takeoff, which was about 100 rpm more than 
during the accident flight.
The previous videos of G-ENAA also showed a more gradual pitch up rotation at liftoff and 
lower pitch attitudes.  Videos of other Mk 26B Spitfires also showed a similar tail-up takeoff  
technique, rotation rates and pitch attitudes.

Aircraft description
The Spitfire Mk 26B 3 is a kit-built scale replica based on the original Spitfire.  The aircraft 
is supplied in kit form from a US based manufacturer.  It is predominantly constructed from 
aluminium alloy skins riveted onto pre-formed frames, ribs and longerons.  Although of a 
smaller scale, the profile of the wings and empennage mirrors that of the original Spitfire 
types.
Footnote
3 The manufacturer introduced a series of scale replica Spitfires identified by their Mark (Mk). The Mk 25 is a 
75% scale single seat aircraft. The Mk 26 is a 80% scale replica twin seat and the Mk 26B is a 90% scale 
replica twin seat. The Mk 26 and 26B fuselage dimensions differ from the Mk 25 but retain the 75% scale 
wing form.

The aircraft’s flying control system is predominantly mechanical, relying on push-pull rods, 
torque tubes, bell cranks and levers to move the aileron, elevator and flap control surfaces.  
An electric motor operated by a switch in the cockpit, drives a common torque tube to move 
the flaps.  There are no specific flap detents, but white marker lines painted on the inboard 
edge of the right aileron allow the pilot to judge flap position.
A trim tab on the right elevator is operated by a lever and Bowden cable 4 mechanism.  
The rudder control system consists of steel cables running from the rudder along the left 
and right side of the fuselage to the rudder pedals in the cockpit.  A second cable runs 
forward from the rudder pedals, to form a continuous cable loop.  This cable includes a 
turnbuckle at its midpoint and is routed through two pulleys on the left and right side of 
the footwell.  The pulleys are mounted on a steel plate, on the aft face of the firewall.  The 
rudder pedal position can be adjusted fore and aft in one of seven positions, but this can 
only be accomplished on the ground.
The pilot’s seat has three positions to allow fore and aft adjustment of the seat on the 
ground by means of a pip-pin.  A four-point harness, incorporating a quick release fitting 
(QRF) was fitted, with the shoulder straps attached to the rear cockpit bulkhead.  G-ENAA 
had provision for a second seat behind the pilot, and this was also equipped with a  
four-point harness.
G-ENAA was powered by an Isuzu V6 fuel injected, normally aspirated, piston engine driving 
a three-blade variable pitch propeller.  It was equipped with an electrically operated main 
landing gear and a fixed tail wheel and had a maximum takeoff weight of 860 kg.
An electrical stall warning tab was fitted to the right wing.  In addition to modern analogue 
instruments, the cockpit instrument panel was equipped with several avionic devices 
including a digital MoTec SDL3 engine and electrical power monitoring display, and digital 
radio and transponder.
Aircraft information
G-ENAA was built and based at Enstone Airfield.  The aircraft was constructed during 2013 
and 2014 by a small team which included the accident pilot.  This was followed by a period 
of test flying between October 2014 and March 2016.  Since then, the aircraft had operated 
on an LAA Permit to Fly, for which the most recent certificate of validity was issued on  
8 July 2024.
The aircraft was not flown between June 2019 and June 2021, nor between March 2022 and 
May 2023, when it was awaiting a replacement propeller following a propeller strike.  For 
the purpose of renewing the Permit to Fly, two flights were flown on 11 May 2024, one on  
14 July and another on 28 July, immediately prior to the accident flight.  The most recent

annual inspection was completed on 30 June 2024 and, among other things, involved 
an engine oil change, replacement of the oil and fuel filters, cleaning of the air filter and 
replacement of the No.2 fuel pump.  The aircraft had accrued a total flight time of 181 hours.
At the time of the accident G-ENAA was one of three Mk 26B’s on the UK register.  
Another Mk 26B, G-CLHJ, was previously destroyed in a fatal accident near Enstone on  
22 August 2023.
Aircraft Handling Notes
After it was built, the aircraft was flown by an LAA test pilot who made the following comments 
in his written report:
‘a. The takeoff was spritely with rapid acceleration.  The tail was lifted at 50 kt 
and a marked swing to the left was experienced.  
b. On earlier flights this swing could hardly be contained even with full application 
of right rudder.  Full rudder deflection was found to be less than the factory 
recommendation but, following adjustment, the rudder deflection was adequate 
to retain directional control.
c. Though the manufacturer indicated a CG envelope of 600 to 875 mm aft 
of datum, the aircraft was found to be longitudinally unstable at CG position  
849 mm aft of datum.  A limit of 745 mm aft of datum was suggested.
d. In the aft CG condition, stick force per g gradient was found to be low so care 
was advised to avoid exceeding maximum g.
e. Initially a marked left wing drop (> 60°) at the stall was exhibited in all 
configurations.  Stall strips were fitted to the inboard leading edge of the wing 
which resulted in satisfactory stalling qualities.
f. There was an audio stall warner fitted which activated 5 to 10 kt prior to all 
stalls.  There was little or no buffet and no tendency to spin.
g. The stalling speed wings level, with idle power was 48 kt flaps up and 43 kt 
with 10° of flap.
h. In a 30° banked left turn at 75% power the stalling speed flaps up was 50 kt 
and with 10° flap 44 kt.
i. The aircraft was found to have adequate pitch trimming at all speeds, except 
in the full flap, gear down, idle power configuration.  In this condition nose up 
trim “ran out” but the control forces were light (of the order two to three pounds) 
and hardly noticeable.’

 AAIB Bulletin:  G-ENAA AAIB-30237
The pilot’s notes for the aircraft, given to the investigation by the syndicate, gave the 
following guidance for takeoff:
‘Expect a tendency to swing to the left, gradually increase to full power, keep 
tailwheel in contact until 50 kt, unstick at 65 kt.  Accelerate to 100 kt whilst 
raising the undercarriage and flaps.’
A tendency to yaw left with increased power is normal for propeller driven aircraft of this 
configuration.  The yaw results from the increasing slipstream from the propeller impinging 
on the left side of the vertical fin.  Syndicate members told the investigation that they did not 
try to keep the tailwheel on the ground until 50 kt during the takeoff roll.  Their usual practice 
was to allow the aircraft tail to rise naturally as the speed increased and they estimated this 
would be at around 35 kt.
In the accident video it appeared that the elevator trim tab was set to approximately its  
mid-travel nose-up trim condition for the takeoff.
Stalling in manoeuvre
The speed at which an aircraft suffers an aerodynamic stall varies as a consequence of 
manoeuvres and the variation of applied acceleration (measured in multiples of g, the 
acceleration due to gravity).  The stalling speed will vary in proportion to the square root of 
the applied g.  So, if an aircraft experiences a force due to an acceleration of 4 g then the 
stalling speed will be twice that in unaccelerated flight.  From an analysis of the accident 
video an estimation of the applied g and, from this, the stalling speed was made to give an 
indication of this effect during this accident.  During the rapid pitch up after takeoff it was 
estimated that the acceleration would be 1.7 g and, therefore, the stalling speed would need 
to be factored by 1.3.  The aircraft had approximately Flap 10 deployed and power applied, 
so from the test pilot’s notes the unaccelerated stall speed would have been approximately 
44 kt.  Factored by 1.3, this would give a stall speed in the manoeuvre of approximately  
57 kt.
Post Stall Autorotation
When an aircraft rolls, the relative airflow (RAF) over each wing is formed from components 
of forward speed and roll as shown in Figure 14.

Figure 14
Change of angle of attack with roll
As an aircraft rolls, the angle of attack on the down going wing is increased.  The lift 
produced by a wing will increase with angle of attack up until the point of a stall.  If angle 
of attack continues to increase beyond the stalling angle then the coefficient of lift (C L) on 
the wing will decrease and so exacerbate the roll.  Deflecting ailerons downward increases 
the angle of attack of a wing, so any attempt to use them in the usual sense post stall will 
increase rather than correct any roll.  As angle of attack increases, the coefficient of drag 
(CD) produced by a wing also increases.  So, if an aircraft rolls left post stall, the lift from the 
left wing will continue to reduce while the drag increases.  The result of these two effects 
is the roll will increase, and the aircraft will yaw to the left.  These effects are illustrated in 
Figure 15.

Aircraft examination 
A preliminary examination of the aircraft was carried out at the accident site with further 
detailed examination conducted at the AAIB facilities.
General
The aircraft had suffered substantial impact damage, forcing the engine into the cockpit 
space.  The intense post-crash fire was focused on the cockpit and centre section of 
aircraft and the majority of components in this area were totally consumed or rendered 
unrecognisable.  The main spar had broken just outboard of the transportation joint, such 
that the left wing was completely detached from the aircraft.  The main landing gear legs 
remained attached to the spar and were extended.
All but the outer third of the left wing had been consumed by the fire and the remainder had 
suffered extensive fire damage.  Nothing remained of the stall warning system that could 
be tested.  The right wing was intact and did not sustain any fire damage.  The right wingtip 
was bent and the damage consistent with it having struck the ground as the aircraft was 
inverted.  There was evidence that a stall strip had been glued to the right wing leading edge 
but it was not present and may have been dislodged in the impact.
Flying controls 
Flying control continuity checks were conducted to the extent possible given the high 
level of disruption to the control systems from impact and fire damage.  Flap and aileron 
control continuity was established on the right wing.  The right wing flaps were found in 
the approximately 30° position but the inboard flap was damaged and the flaps may have 
moved during the impact sequence.
The horizontal stabiliser, elevators and trim tab on the right elevator appeared undamaged.  
The elevator moved freely and control continuity was established to just aft of the cockpit.  
Forward of this point, the control rod and linkage to the control column had been consumed 
by the fire.
The elevator trim tab was deflected approximately 20° down 5 (nose-up trim) and could not 
be moved from this position.  The solid end fitting of the elevator trim cable was bent where 
it attached to the trim tab.  The elevator trim cable had suffered varying degrees of heat 
damage along its length and the solid core could not be moved.  In the areas where the fire 
had been most intense the outer plastic sleeve was completely absent and in other areas it 
had shrunk and formed around the steel sleeve.  The inner anti-friction liner had melted and 
subsequently solidified in places, preventing movement of the cable.  The trim tab moved 
freely once the cable was disconnected.
Footnote
5 The elevator trim tab on the Mk 26B provides only nose-up trim (surface down).  Examination of another  
Mk 26B showed that setting the trim lever to the full aft position corresponded to maximum nose-up trim  
(24o downwards surface deflection of the trim tab).  When the trim lever was in the fully forward position, the 
trim tab was in the neutral position.

 AAIB Bulletin:  G-ENAA AAIB-30237
The routing of trim cable did not precisely follow the cable routing described in the Mk 26B 
constructor’s manual.  The outer plastic cover exhibited surface abrasion damage in several 
locations, and in one place was snagged where the cable passed through lightning holes in 
the fuselage frames.
The rear rudder cable loop was intact and continuity with the rudder surface was established 
by manually operating the cables, but the range of movement could not be checked because 
the top of the rudder was bent.  Only the right rudder pedal assembly survived the fire.  All 
that remained of the left rudder pedal was the brake cylinder.  
Part of the forward rudder cable loop survived.  The cable had failed in tension at the left 
side and the cable had been pulled to the right, such that the turnbuckle was jammed in 
the right pulley.  This would have occurred when the engine firewall structure, on which the 
cable pulleys were mounted, was severely deformed during the impact sequence.
The AAIB investigation into the fatal accident to Spitfire Mk 26B, registration G-CLHJ, 
in August 2023 identified that the aircraft had been built with a misaligned rudder.  This 
finding resulted in the LAA issuing a Mandatory Technical Directive to inspect the geometry, 
symmetry and rigging of the fin and rudder on all Mk 26 and Mk 26B Spitfires.  G-ENAA was 
subject to that check in May 2024 and no anomalies were noted.
Seat
While the pilot’s seat and much of its support structure were destroyed in the fire, the 
parts of the seat mounting structure which contained the seat adjustment mechanism were 
located in the wreckage and the pip pins were located in the middle position.  This ruled out 
the possibility of the seat having moved during the takeoff.
Survivability
After the left wingtip struck the ground the aircraft continued to roll and came to rest inverted.  
Immediately after the aircraft struck the ground there was an intense fire which engulfed the 
cockpit area.  The combination of accident and post-impact fire was not survivable.
The safety harness straps and seat furnishings had been destroyed by the fire, so limited 
assessment was possible.  Two QRFs were identified in the wreckage; one, believed to be 
from the pilot’s seat harness, had all four strap end fittings inserted into it and the other had 
only the fixed end fitting inserted.
Weight and balance
The pilot’s weight was estimated at 70 kg and the fuel load remaining after the first sortie 
was approximately 85 litres.  There was no baggage aboard the aircraft.  Using those figures 
gave an aircraft mass of 781 kg and a CG position 690 mm aft of the datum.  The aircraft 
was therefore within its mass and CG envelope.

Meteorology
The weather was good with only a light crosswind from the left.  It was not considered to be 
a factor in the accident. 
Post mortem report
Following the accident, the pilot’s heart was examined by a consultant histopathologist.  The 
results of that examination indicated that the pilot had coronary artery disease (ischaemic 
heart disease), and ‘in the absence of other post-mortem findings, the severity of his coronary 
artery disease would be sufficient to account for a sudden cardiac death’.   In response to 
a request for clarification, the pathologist indicated that a ‘sudden cardiac arrhythmia … 
would likely have rendered him incapacitated very quickly’.  He also said that ‘he may have 
had an obstruction to a coronary artery resulting in chest pain that would have impaired his 
ability to control the aircraft’.
The pilot had last undergone an aviation medical ECG in December 2022 which was 
assessed as normal.  The pathologist stated that between 15 and 20% of sudden deaths 
due to ischaemic heart disease occur in patients with no previous history of the condition.
A summary of the report produced by the consultant histopathologist was included in the 
post mortem (PM) report written by a forensic pathologist.  The PM report referred to the 
specialist examination of the pilot’s heart and stated:
‘There was no evidence of an acute blockage … that would have meant [the 
pilot] had been subject to sudden cardiac deterioration.  However, the absence 
of acute blockage does not exclude a sudden cardiac deterioration (noting, of 
course that the level of disease would have been the same the preceding day, 
week and likely months with no (known) ill-effect)’.
The PM report referred to the section of the consultant histopathologist’s report that stated:
‘There are contraction bands within the myocardium which may be associated 
with acute ischaemia but may be seen in resuscitation and correlation with the 
clinical history is required’.
The PM report stated:
‘Whilst this observation may suggest that the deceased was suffering from 
“acute ischaemia” – a reduction in blood flow to the heart muscle – and thus 
could be of potential relevance, it is suggested [in a referenced work] that this 
may arise as an artefact including in fatal air crashes’.
The PM report stated that soot staining of the main airways ‘indicated that [the pilot] was 
alive during the course of a fire’  (which occurred after the aircraft struck the ground).  It 
went on to state that ‘The medical cause of death can best be attributed to: Effects of Fire 
(principally inhalation of products of combustion)’.

Comments from the CAA
The CAA was consulted on how the medical evidence should be interpreted in relation 
to the accident sequence and commented that ‘there is evidence of control input which 
would not have occurred with an incapacitated individual’.  This was in reference to the 
right roll input that was seen in response to the left roll.  The CAA also considered that the 
observation that the pilot’s head was upright during the first part of the takeoff indicated that 
he was not incapacitated at that point.
The CAA pointed out that coronary artery disease is ‘extremely common, with a prevalence 
of almost 70% in males of this age’.
