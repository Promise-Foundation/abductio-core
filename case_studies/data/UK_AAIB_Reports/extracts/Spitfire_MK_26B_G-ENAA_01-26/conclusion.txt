Immediately after takeoff the aircraft stalled during a rapid pitch up.  Control was lost and 
the aircraft rolled and yawed left as a result of a post-stall autorotation.  The left wing struck 
the ground, the aircraft came to rest inverted and caught fire, and the pilot was fatally 
injured.  Despite the extensive damage sustained during the impact and ensuing fire, there 
was no evidence of a malfunction or failure of any of the aircraft’s flying control systems that 
would explain a loss of control.  It was possible that the pilot did not control the yaw during 
the takeoff run, initiated a rapid pitch up to lift off before running off the side of the runway 
and, in so doing, began the sequence of events.  Although the medical evidence did not 
permit a definitive conclusion, it was also possible that the reason for the loss of control was 
that the pilot became incapacitated to some extent during the takeoff.
