The aircraft was on final approach to Runway 09 at Gloucestershire Airport when the engine
lost power, resulting in the aircraft landing short of the runway and colliding with the ILS
localiser antenna array.  A plastic air induction elbow attached to the engine had softened
and collapsed during the landing approach, causing the loss of power.  The Light Aircraft
Association (LAA) intends to take two safety actions in response to this accident concerning
the use of 3D printed parts.
