The aircraft’s engine failed to produce power on final approach due to the collapse of the 
air induction elbow, which severely restricted the induction airflow into the fuel controller.  
When the pilot realised that the engine was no longer producing power, the options for a 
safe landing were limited by the low altitude and obstacles ahead of the aircraft.
The induction elbow collapsed due to the elbow’s 3D-printed plastic material softening 
when exposed to heat from the engine.  It is possible that extension of the aircraft’s belly 
airbrake created a low-pressure zone beneath the lower engine cowling, drawing air over 
the exhaust piping in the upper cowling area downwards and over the induction elbow, 
which may have added to the existing radiant heating of the elbow from the engine.
Installation of the 3D-printed induction elbow as part of the fuel system modification was not 
identified as a hazard by the aircraft owner, as he believed that the temperature capability 
of the filament material used in the induction elbow was at least equivalent to the laminated 
epoxy material version specified in the aircraft’s build manual.  Testing of the elbow’s material 
after the accident showed that it had a significantly lower glass transition temperature than 
epoxy resin, although the exact material composition of the 3D-printed elbow was not 
determined.  The 3D-printed induction elbow also did not include the section of aluminium 
tube at its forward end, which would have provided additional structural support to the elbow 
despite the elevated temperature present within the lower engine cowling.
As the parts list supplied to LAA Engineering for the fuel system modification did not include 
the 3D-printed induction elbow, it was not able to independently assess its airworthiness as 
part of the modification process.
