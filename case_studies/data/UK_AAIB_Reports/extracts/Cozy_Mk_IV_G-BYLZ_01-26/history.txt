The aircraft returned to Gloucestershire Airport after an uneventful local flight operating
up to FL80.  The pilot flew a Required Navigation Performance (RNP) approach to
Runway 09, intending to go around on final approach.  He extended the belly airbrake during
the approach.  On short final, at about 500 ft agl, he advanced the throttle and realised that
the engine had suffered a complete loss of power.  He managed to fly over a road and a
line of bushes on the airfield boundary, but landed short and struck the ILS localiser before
coming to rest at the side of the structure (Figure 1).

Aircraft information
The Cozy Mk IV is a kit-built four-seat 1 canard aircraft powered by a single piston engine
driving a pusher propeller.  It is equipped with a belly-mounted airbrake to increase drag
in the landing configuration.  A modification application was made to the LAA in 2019, by
the aircraft owner2, to replace the engine’s throttle body fuel injector with a mechanical fuel
injection system.  This system consisted of a fuel controller, high-pressure engine-driven
fuel pump, electric auxiliary fuel pump, fuel flow transducer and associated fuel hoses,
filters and fittings.  Following flight testing, the modified fuel system was approved by the
LAA in 2022.  The modified fuel injection system had accumulated 37 hours in service when
the accident occurred.
Aircraft examination
Examination of the aircraft revealed that a plastic air induction elbow attached to the fuel
controller had collapsed (Figure 3), severely restricting the induction airflow to the engine,
causing the loss of power.

Collapsed air induction elbow
The air induction elbow was a 3D-printed plastic component that had been installed during
the modification to the fuel system.  A forward-facing air filter had been clamped to the
forward end of the elbow, but this had detached and was found loose in the lower engine
cowling.

The aircraft owner who installed the modified fuel system stated that the 3D-printed induction
elbow was purchased in the USA at an airshow, and he understood from the vendor that it
was printed from CF-ABS (carbon fibre – acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) filament material,
with a glass transition temperature3 of 105°C.
An alternative construction method for the air induction elbow, shown in the Cozy Mk IV
plans, is a lamination of four layers of bi-directional glassfibre cloth with epoxy resin.  The
epoxy resin specified for the laminate has a glass transition temperature of 84 °C, after the
finished part has been post-cured.  The aircraft owner stated that as the glass transition
temperature listed for the CF-ABS material was higher than the epoxy resin, he was satisfied
the component was fit for use in this application when it was installed.
A review of the design of the laminated induction elbow in the Cozy Mk IV plans showed
that it featured a section of thin-walled aluminium tube at the inlet end of the elbow, where
the air filter is attached.  The aluminium tube provides a degree of temperature-insensitive
structural support for the inlet end of the elbow.  The 3D-printed induction elbow on G-BYLZ
did not include a similar section of aluminium tube at the inlet end.
Tests and research
Two samples from the air induction elbow were subjected to testing, using a heat-flux
differential scanning calorimeter, to determine their glass transition temperature.  The
measured glass transition temperature for the first sample was 52.8 °C, and 54.0°C for the
second sample.
Other information
LAA modification process
The modified fuel system fitted to G-BYLZ was treated as a prototype modification by
LAA Engineering.  This required the aircraft owner to complete an initial modification
proposal form, LAA Form MOD 2, for LAA Engineering to assess whether the modification
was feasible.  The modification was determined to be so, with the LAA classifying the
modification as minor and requiring the owner to provide a full description of the fuel system
modifications by completing LAA Form MOD 3.  Section 6 of the MOD 3 form is a parts list of
components to be fitted for the modification.  The parts list submitted by the owner included
the components of the modified fuel system but omitted the 3D-printed air induction elbow.
The airworthiness of the 3D-printed induction elbow was therefore not assessed by LAA
Engineering during its evaluation of the fuel system modification, as it was not aware of the
presence of this component on the aircraft.
