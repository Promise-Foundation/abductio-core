The engine lost power during final approach because a plastic air induction elbow attached 
to the engine softened and collapsed, severely reducing the engine’s induction airflow.  The 
induction elbow was constructed from an inappropriate material for the elevated temperature 
present within the lower engine cowling.  The elbow was installed as part of a modification 
to the aircraft’s fuel system, however due to omission of the elbow on the modification parts 
list, LAA Engineering was not able to independently assess its airworthiness as part of the 
modification process.
Planned safety actions
The LAA intends to publish a ‘LAA Alert’ regarding the use of 3D-printed parts that will 
be sent to all LAA Inspectors.  This alert will also be referenced in the Engine TADS  
(Type Acceptance Data Sheet) for all engine types, ensuring that it is used as a reference 
each time the Permit to Fly for an LAA aircraft is revalidated.
