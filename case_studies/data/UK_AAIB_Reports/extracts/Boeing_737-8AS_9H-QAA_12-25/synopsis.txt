While being pushed back by a tug at London Stansted Airport, the aircraft’s tail struck the
blast fence at the end of the taxiway.  This caused extensive damage to the rear of the
aircraft, including its APU.
The airport operator has taken safety action by making the ‘Tug release point’ ground
markings more prominent.  The report discusses ways to prioritise tasks and maintain
situation awareness, and the importance of ground crew being vigilant of each other, and
being ready to act when things do not go as expected.
