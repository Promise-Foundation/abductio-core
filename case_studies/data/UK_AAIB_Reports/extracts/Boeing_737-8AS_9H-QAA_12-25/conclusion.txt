The aircraft was pushed beyond the TRP while the tug driving instructor was focussed on
training another driver, while performing the driving task.  It struck a blast fence at the end
of a cul-de-sac.
The report discusses task prioritisation and situation awareness tools; and the importance
of ground crew remaining vigilant of one another and being ready to act when things don’t
go as expected.
