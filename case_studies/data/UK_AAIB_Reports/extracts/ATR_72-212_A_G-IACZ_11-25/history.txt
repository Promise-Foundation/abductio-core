The plan was to fly two sectors as a return service between Newquay and London Gatwick.
The crew rejected the initial aircraft because of water ingress on the flight deck, but they
accepted G-IACZ as an alternative airframe.
The return sector to Newquay proceeded normally with the commander electing to fly the
approach because the weather conditions were described as challenging.  When the flaps
were selected to 30° for landing, the cockpit indications showed that they remained at 15°
and the cabin crew confirmed that the flaps had not extended.  Recycling the flap lever had
no effect, and the commander decided to perform a go-around.  As the aircraft climbed
away there was an intermittent airframe de-ice fault and a “ MAYDAY” was declared.  The
crew decided to divert to Exeter, where the flaps extended normally.

Investigation
The operator tested the flap system on the ground and no faults were apparent.  The AAIB
downloaded the Flight Data Recorder, which showed an anomaly with the flap command
signal during the approach to Newquay.  This information was passed to the operator, who
released the aircraft for further flight after functional testing was complete.  The aircraft
completed several flights without recurrence, until the flaps stopped responding to selections
again.  The operator sought advice from the aircraft manufacturer, who recommended
installing a replacement flap selector switch.  This was completed and no further flap
problems have been reported on G-IACZ.
