The flaps could not be deployed to full extension for landing and the commander decided
to perform a go-around.  Weather conditions were unfavourable so after initially declaring
a MAYDAY, the aircraft diverted to Exeter Airport where landing flap was achieved.  The
landing was uneventful, but several unrelated anomalies were reported to have occurred
during the subsequent ground taxi.
