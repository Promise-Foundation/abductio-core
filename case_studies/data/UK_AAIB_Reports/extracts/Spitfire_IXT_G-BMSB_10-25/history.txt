The aircraft was operating on a Safety Standards Acknowledgement and Consent (SSAC)
passenger flight and was flying in formation with another Spitfire.  It had been flying for
about 35 minutes and was roughly two miles south of Lympne Castle in Kent, when the pilot
noticed a slight engine vibration.  He checked the engine temperatures, pressures and rpm,
all of which appeared normal.  However, within five seconds of the onset of the vibration,
the engine rapidly lost power.  It then briefly recovered, surged and appeared to lose
power again.  The engine started to backfire and the pilot observed dark coloured smoke
emanating from the exhausts.  He briefly experimented with moving the throttle to see if he
could find a point where the engine would produce power, but this was unsuccessful.  The
pilot noted a smell of fuel in the cockpit so suspected a fuel problem.  The aircraft rapidly lost
airspeed and the pilot lowered the nose, chose a suitable area of open ground and made a
gradual 10° right turn to line up and carry out a forced landing.  He briefed his passenger,
who remained calm throughout.  He was in radio contact with the other Spitfire pilot who
relayed a MAYDAY to Biggin Hill ATC on his behalf.  He then concentrated on maintaining
airspeed and energy throughout the descent but was able to establish the low fuel pressure
warning light had illuminated so selected the boost pump on.  He also checked the magneto
switches but neither action made any difference.  He decided not to lower the landing
gear.  He made a slight heading adjustment to avoid overflying a caravan park and reduced
the airspeed to 100 kt, closed the throttle and prepared for touchdown.  He briefed his
passenger to brace, gently rounded out and landed in the field.  The aircraft remained
upright and the pilot described how the aircraft came to a stop “surprisingly quickly”.  The
pilot and passenger vacated the cockpit unaided.  The passenger suffered minor bruising
and the pilot was uninjured.  The aircraft sustained damage to its underside and propeller.

Engine fuel system description
Fuel is supplied to the supercharger by a Bendix injection carburettor.  This system relies
on accurate metering of fuel to the discharge nozzle to inject fuel into the supercharger at
a pressure of about 5 psi, in response to the throttle demands and flight conditions.  To
achieve this, a constant supply of pressurised fuel is required.  A drop in fuel pressure may
cause an engine malfunction and so a fuel pressure warning light is fitted in the cockpit.
This warning light is controlled by a low pressure warning switch fitted to the carburettor.
Aircraft examination and cause
The aircraft was recovered to the operator’s maintenance facility and examined.  From the
description given by the pilot, a substantial fuel leak within the engine bay was suspected.
This was confirmed and a gasket fitted to the carburettor fuel low pressure switch assembly
cover plate, was found to have degraded (Figure 2) probably due to ageing.   The switch
had developed an external leak at system pressure, because casement securing screws
on the switch body had loosened off.  Aging effects in elastomeric components, such as the
gasket, include shrinking and hardening and it is possible that this resulted in the screws
no longer being at the correct clamping torque.  The fuel pressure switch was at least
70 years old and its last overhaul date was unknown.

The leak allowed pressurised fuel to spray into the lower rear part of the engine bay, above
and into the air filter box.  The fuel was then being drawn into the air flow, affecting the fuel
air mixture, so the engine was running extremely rich.  This directly resulted in the engine
vibration and power loss.

Ageing components
The CAA found that similar types of pressure switch, with various part numbers and
modification states, were used in the fuel and hydraulic systems of various piston and gas
turbine powered aircraft from the 1940’s to the 1980’s.  Many such historic aircraft are still
in operation within the UK.
As a result of this occurrence, the CAA issued Safety Notice (SN) SN-2025-009 ‘Maintenance
of historic piston and gas turbine airframe fuel/hydraulic system switches and components’,
dated 9 June 2025.  The SN informs historic aircraft operators and maintenance organisations
of the importance of monitoring and maintaining the airworthiness of ageing tertiary fuel and
hydraulic system switches and similar components.
It emphasises the need to have procedures in place to identify components that may be
affected by age degradation or extended use and, to ensure that the aircraft maintenance
programme includes provisions for regular inspection, periodic operational and functional
checks, and calendar life limits, for such components.
Pilot’s comments
The pilot described his actions and thought process in detail from which several important
safety aspects were noted.  The Spitfire is a high-performance aircraft designed for speed
and manoeuvrability, but with a loss of power and windmilling propeller, energy management
to maintain control is paramount.
The pilot described how he made several decisions in order not to reduce or lose energy.
He did not lower the landing gear or jettison the canopy, as the resultant drag would have
been detrimental to his stable glide speed and rate of descent.
Prioritising the need to fly the aircraft and, faced with a high workload, he asked the pilot
in the accompanying aircraft to carry out the radio communications.  This allowed him to
concentrate more fully on the forced landing.  He also noted that his passenger, who was
an experienced professional commercial pilot, remained calm throughout.
Reflecting on the forced landing, the pilot considered factors which had contributed to the
successful outcome.  These included being mindful of height in the cruise, to provide more
time for decision making in the event of an emergency and avoiding overflying built up areas
in a single engine aircraft.  He described the benefits of performing practice forced landings
on a regular basis.  This was something he routinely did and also emphasised to students
in his role as a flying instructor/class rating instructor.
He also felt that the operator’s policy of holding regular ‘What if?’ discussions, which had in
the past covered power loss and forced landings, greatly helped in his handling of the event.
