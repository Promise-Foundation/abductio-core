The aircraft had been flying for about 35 minutes when the pilot noticed a slight engine
vibration.  This was rapidly followed by a power loss.  The pilot noted a distinct smell of fuel
in the cockpit and suspected a fuel problem.  He briefed his passenger and established a
stable glide descent to carry out a wheels-up forced landing in a field.  The aircraft landed
on its underside and came to a stop (Figure 1).  The passenger suffered minor injuries and
the pilot was uninjured.
The power loss was caused by the failure, probably age related, of a gasket, fitted within the
pressure switch for the fuel low pressure warning light, which is attached to the carburettor.
This allowed pressurised fuel to spray into the lower rear part of the engine bay, above
and into, the air filter box.  The fuel was then drawn into the air flow affecting the fuel air
mixture, so the engine was running extremely rich.  This resulted in the engine vibration and
subsequent power loss.
In response to this occurrence, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) published a safety notice
relating to airworthiness considerations for ageing fuel and hydraulic system components.
