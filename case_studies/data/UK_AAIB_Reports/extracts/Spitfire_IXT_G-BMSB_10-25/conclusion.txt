The engine lost power when a failed gasket in the fuel pressure warning switch, allowed
pressurised fuel to spray into the engine bay and be drawn into the induction system.  This
led to an overly rich fuel mixture, resulting in the power loss.
The pilot completed a successful forced landing because his training and practice enabled
him to identify a suitable landing site within the gliding capability of the aircraft, to prioritise
his actions and to effectively manage the aircraft energy.
Safety action
The Civil Aviation Authority issued Safety Notice SN-2025-009 to inform
historic aircraft operators and maintainers of the importance of monitoring
and maintaining the airworthiness of ageing tertiary fuel and hydraulic system
switches and similar components.
