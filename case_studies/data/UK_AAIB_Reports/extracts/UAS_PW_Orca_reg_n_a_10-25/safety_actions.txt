Following this accident the following safety actions were taken:
The aircraft manufacturer has:
 ● Notified all operators about the safety critical software issue. 
 ● Released new software to resolve the protection logic to ensure that the 
‘deglitch’ filter does not interfere with the arm/disarm switch protection 
function.
 ● Updated the flight and ground control manuals to highlight the importance of 
switch state positions and to include additional information on the operation 
of the FTS and disarm function.
The aircraft manufacturer also stated that it is considering a change to the aircraft’s software 
that will prevent the aircraft being manually disarmed in flight (remove power from motors 
and disable the FTS) using the RP ground station or SRP controller.  This software change 
is expected to be released in August 2025.
The aircraft operator has:
 ● Grounded all flights of this aircraft type until such time that it completed a 
revalidation process to determine the aircraft’s suitability for future operation 
following changes to the aircraft’s software.
 ● Updated its flight reference cards to include checks that switch selections of 
the RP ground control station match those of the SRP controller.
The aircraft operator also advised that it is reviewing the advantages and disadvantages of 
continuing to operate the aircraft with an SRP.
