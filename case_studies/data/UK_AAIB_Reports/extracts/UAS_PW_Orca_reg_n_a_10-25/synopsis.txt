The aircraft struck the ground in a wooded area whilst on approach to land at a site adjacent 
to Coventry Hospital.  The accident occurred during the sixth consecutive flight, which was in 
preparation for demonstrating the aircraft being operated in accordance with the operator’s 
Beyond Visual Line Of Sight with Visual Mitigations (BVLOS VM) authorisation.
The cause of the accident was identified as a software bug in combination with a loss 
of synchronisation between the Remote Pilot (RP) and the Safety Remote Pilot (SRP), 
whereby the SRP’s hand controller had remained set to the disarm position when the 
aircraft had taken off.  When the aircraft came within range of the SRP’s controller, this 
resulted in power being removed from the aircraft’s electric propulsion motors, leading to 
the aircraft stalling, its emergency parachute system being disabled, and a subsequent 
uncontrolled descent from a height of 60 m.
